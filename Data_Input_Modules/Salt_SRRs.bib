Recent studies have suggested that high salt intake could also be associated with adverse effects on cardiovascular system. The review evaluated the current level of epidemiologic evidence on the association between the level of habitual salt intake and stroke outcome. We also suggest further research direction. There were 21 independent samples from 12 studies, with 225,693 participants (follow-up, 3–19 years) and 8135 stroke events. High salt intake was associated with risk of stroke event (pooled odd ratio [{OR}], 1.34; 95\% conﬁdence interval [{CI}], 1.19–1.51), stroke death (1.40; 1.21–1.63) and stroke onset (1.11; 1.00–1.24), ischemic stroke death (2.15; 1.57–2.95), not associated with risk of ischemic stroke onset (1.07, 0.95–1.2), with no signiﬁcant evidence of publication bias. High salt intake is associated with signiﬁcantly increased risk of stroke event. Further research should be directed toward clarifying and quantifying these possible effects and generating testable hypotheses on plausible biologic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Despite efforts over the past several decades to reduce sodium intake in the United States, adults still consume an average of 3,400 mg of sodium every day. A number of scientific bodies and professional health organizations, including the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association, support reducing dietary sodium intake. These organizations support a common goal to reduce daily sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams and further reduce intake to 1,500 mg among persons who are 51 years of age and older and those of any age who are African-American or have hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.{\textbackslash}{nA} substantial body of evidence supports these efforts to reduce sodium intake. This evidence links excessive dietary sodium to high blood pressure, a surrogate marker for cardiovascular disease ({CVD}), stroke, and cardiac-related mortality. However, concerns have been raised that a low sodium intake may adversely affect certain risk factors, including blood lipids and insulin resistance, and thus potentially increase risk of heart disease and stroke. In fact, several recent reports have challenged sodium reduction in the population as a strategy to reduce this risk.{\textbackslash}{nSodium} Intake in Populations recognizes the limitations of the available evidence, and explains that there is no consistent evidence to support an association between sodium intake and either a beneficial or adverse effect on most direct health outcomes other than some {CVD} outcomes (including stroke and {CVD} mortality) and all-cause mortality. Some evidence suggested that decreasing sodium intake could possibly reduce the risk of gastric cancer. However, the evidence was too limited to conclude the converse{\textbackslash}u2014that higher sodium intake could possibly increase the risk of gastric cancer. Interpreting these findings was particularly challenging because most studies were conducted outside the United States in populations consuming much higher levels of sodium than those consumed in this country. Sodium Intake in Populations is a summary of the findings and conclusions on evidence for associations between sodium intake and risk of {CVD}-related events and mortality.},

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether elevated dietary Na intake could be associated with {CVD} mortality. Design: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies representing the general population. The adjusted relative risks and their 95 \% conﬁdence intervals were pooled by the inverse variance method using random-effects models. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed. Settings: {MEDLINE} (since 1973), Embase (since 1975), the Cochrane Library (since 1976), {ISI} Web of Science, Google Scholar (until September 2013) and secondary referencing were searched for inclusion in the study. Subject: Eleven prospective studies with 229 785 participants and average followup period of 13·37 years (range 5·5–19 years).
Results: Higher Na intake was signiﬁcantly associated with higher {CVD} mortality (relative risk = 1·12; 95 \% {CI} 1·06, 1·19). In the sensitivity analysis, the exclusion of studies with important relative weights did not signiﬁcantly affect the results (relative risk = 1·08; 95 \% {CI} 1·01, 1·15). The meta-regression analysis showed that for every increase of 10 mmol/d in Na intake, {CVD} mortality increased signiﬁcantly by 1 \% (P = 0·016). Age, hypertensive status and length of follow-up were also associated with increased {CVD} mortality.
Conclusions: Higher Na intake was associated with higher {CVD} mortality in the general population; this result suggests a reduction in Na intake to prevent {CVD} mortality from any cause.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies published 1966-2008. Data sources Medline (1966-2008), Embase (from 1988), {AMED} (from 1985), {CINAHL} (from 1982), Psychinfo (from 1985), and the Cochrane Library. Review methods For each study, relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals were extracted and pooled with a random effect model, weighting for the inverse of the variance. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. Criteria for inclusion were prospective adult population study, assessment of salt intake as baseline exposure, assessment of either stroke or total cardiovascular disease as outcome, follow-up of at least three years, indication of number of participants exposed and number of events across different salt intake categories.
Results There were 19 independent cohort samples from 13 studies, with 177 025 participants (follow-up 3. 5-19 years) and over 11 000 vascular events. Higher salt intake was associated with greater risk of stroke (pooled relative risk 1.23, 95\% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.43; P=0.007) and cardiovascular disease (1.14, 0.99 to 1.32; P=0.07), with no significant evidence of publication bias. For cardiovascular disease, sensitivity analysis showed that the exclusion of a single study led to a pooled estimate of 1.17 (1.02 to 1.34; P=0.02). The associations observed were greater the larger the difference in sodium intake and the longer the follow-up.
Conclusions High salt intake is associated with significantly increased risk of stroke and total cardiovascular disease. Because of imprecision in measurement of salt intake, these effect sizes are likely to be underestimated. These results support the role of a substantial population reduction in salt intake for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, and bibliographies. Study selection Unconfounded randomised trials that aimed to reduce sodium intake in healthy adults over at least 6 months. Inclusion decisions, validity and data extraction were duplicated. Random effects meta-analysis, subgrouping, sensitivity analysis, and meta-regression were performed. Outcomes Mortality, cardiovascular events, blood pressure, urinary sodium excretion, quality of life, and use of antihypertensive drugs.
Results Three trials in normotensive people (n=2326), five trials in those with untreated hypertension (n=387), and three trials in people being treated for hypertension (n=801) were included, with follow up from six months to seven years. The large high quality (and therefore most informative) studies used intensive behavioural interventions. Deaths and cardiovascular events were inconsistently defined and reported. There were 17 deaths, equally distributed between intervention and control groups. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced (systolic by 1.1 mm Hg, 95\% confidence interval 1.8 to 0.4 mm Hg; diastolic by 0.6 mm Hg, 1.5 to − 0.3 mm Hg) at 13 to 60 months, as was urinary 24 hour sodium excretion (by 35.5 mmol/24 hours, 47.2 to 23.9). Degree of reduction in sodium intake and change in blood pressure were not related.
Conclusions Intensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only small reductions in blood pressure and sodium excretion, and effects on deaths and cardiovascular events are unclear. Advice to reduce sodium intake may help people on antihypertensive drugs to stop their medication while maintaining good blood pressure control.},
