# computable-bibliography
## Project Description  
The goal is to compute multidimensional bibliographies, where the dimensions include: title, journal name, publication year, issue, page number, authors. We will do this by gathering bibliographic data from various databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Crossref, etc. The outcome ofthe project is to compute “relatedness” between any two bibliographies and form a “relatedness matrix”. This will be used in the future to contribute to tools that will assist in decision-making.  

## Steps to Run
- Get Scopus API Key and INST Token. Paste it in the config.json file
- Run data-extraction.py file  
- Run computing-bibliography.ipynb file
