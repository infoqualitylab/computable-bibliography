Graphical abstract Recent advances in formulation sciences have expanded the previously limited design space for biological modalities, including peptide, protein, and vaccine products. At the same time, the discovery and application of new modalities, such as cellular therapies and gene therapies, have presented formidable challenges to formulation scientists. We explore these challenges and highlight the opportunities to overcome them through the development of novel formulations and drug delivery systems as biological solids. We review the current progress in both industry and academic laboratories, and we provide expert perspectives in those settings. Formulation scientists have made a tremendous effort to accommodate the needs of these novel delivery routes. These include stability-preserving formulations and dehydration processes as well as dosing regimes and dosage forms that improve patient compliance. Keywords Biological solids Vaccines Gene therapy Cell therapy Bacteriophage Peptides Proteins Solid dosage forms 1 Introduction Biologics are active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that usually originate from living organisms. In general, they cannot be chemically synthesized. These APIs are characterized by their large molecular weights (i.e., >1 kDa) and molecular diversity, unlike small-molecule APIs [1]. Biologics generally include therapeutic modalities such as virus (including bacteriophage and mammalian virus vaccines), peptides, proteins, nucleic acids or their analogs, and cell or tissue products [1,2]. In 2019, the total sales of 55 biologic therapeutics (36 antibodies and 19 therapeutic proteins) exceeded USD 1 billion [3]. The growing success of biologic therapeutics can be attributed to their favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles as well as their target specificity compared to small-molecule APIs [4]. Additionally, biologic therapeutics provide first-in-class strategies for the management of refractory conditions [2]. Unfortunately, they also introduce new challenges in terms of stabilization, manufacturing, transportation, and storage. Currently, the vast majority of biologics on the market must be delivered via the parenteral route due to their poor oral bioavailability and limited epithelial transport [4]. The majority of these injection formulations are in a liquid form [5]. As commonly known, drugs in the solid-state are typically more stable than in the liquid state, and the differences are especially prominent in biological modalities due to their sensitivity to the environment [6]. Solution characteristics, including pH, ion strength, oxidant level, surface tension, are highly impactful to the stabilities of protein, bacteriophage, cell living, and gene-delivery vehicle complex. In addition, stresses during manufacturing, packaging, handling, and storage condition can also easily cause product failure, such as temperature changes, light exposure during storage, liquid\u2013solid interface tension when contacting package or filling apparatus, and air\u2013liquid interface tension caused by agitation. Moreover, the existence of water is a natural inducer of hydrolysis. These stresses can lead to both chemical and physical instability of the relatively vulnerable biological molecules/complexes. Recently, significant efforts have been focused on reformulating parenterally administered biologics approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patient-friendly, noninvasive routes of administration. This reformulation is incentivized for both patients and pharmaceutical companies: patients experience the ease of administration, improved safety, decreased healthcare costs, and increased adherence [7,8]; meanwhile, manufacturers overcome cold chain problems and related supply issues, as well as extend the patent life and market exclusivity of the reformulated products [9]. Formulating biologics as biological solids is a highly promising and significant area of research that can allow for the noninvasive administration of biologics. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated measurable bioavailability and therapeutic activity in biological solids administered orally, buccally, transdermally, subcutaneously or through inhalation, Fig. 1 . Furthermore, formulating a biological product in the solid state confers greater stability and more favorable storage requirements. However, much is left to learn. This is emphasized by the fact that no peptide product has been approved for oral administration before it was first approved for parenteral delivery [10]. New research must improve processing methods and overcome physiological barriers to facilitate this transition from parenterally administered biologics to other more convenient routes such as oral or inhalation. This review explores these challenges and reviews the current efforts in both academia and industry toward developing solid formulations for vaccines, gene therapies, recently emerging modalities, and peptide and protein products, along with the authors\u2019 comments and perspectives. 2 Vaccine products Vaccines, in general, are one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. There are a variety of different vaccine types; from the very complex, including live attenuated and inactivated viral or bacterial vaccines, to subunit vaccines, polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, and toxoid vaccines. In addition, several novel types of vaccines are in various stages of development, including mRNA and DNA vaccines. Furthermore, therapeutic vaccines have also been investigated to combat cancer and allergies. This article discusses the key advantages as well as the limitations of vaccine drug product development, along with newer methodologies to improve their delivery. 2.1 Introduction Prophylactic vaccines not only lessen the overall healthcare burden by preventing and controlling diseases; in certain specific cases, they eradicate the disease altogether. A devastating disease like smallpox, for example, has been eliminated through the widespread global distribution and administration of vaccines. Similarly, the disease burden associated with diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, and rubella has been reduced substantially [11]. Despite the progress made, reducing the risk of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases requires continuous investment in the research and development of new vaccines (e.g., Ebola, Zika, SARS-CoV-2) [12,13] and remains a challenging task. These challenges include the lack of a true biomarker that can serve as an immune correlate for protection, the lack of suitable in vitro and in vivo models, poor translatability between animal models and human clinical trials, the lack of a structure\u2013function correlation for analytical characterization and bridging, and the requirement to demonstrate safety and efficacy across large and diverse patient populations to achieve marketing approval. Furthermore, new and improved ways to stabilize and administer vaccines are critical for the continuous improvement of public health and compliance. The intrinsic instability of vaccines makes global vaccine coverage difficult, especially the expansion of vaccine usage in developing countries. This is often due to a lack of an established cold-chain footprint in these markets. In addition, developing countries often lack the healthcare infrastructure required for the widespread administration of traditional, parenteral vaccine products. Thus, for worldwide coverage, the scope of drug product development must expand beyond merely developing a safe and efficacious vaccine product. The stresses associated with packaging, storage, shipping, and distribution (e.g., shear stress, thermal stress) must be considered. In addition, one primary consideration during development must be the administration route of the vaccine, with a focus on patient access in underserved regions. We provide a brief overview of product development, while highlighting the key considerations and opportunities associated with vaccine drug delivery, based on the authors\u2019 perspectives as well as certain case studies. The value and impact of vaccines could not be more obvious given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; thus, we include a section dedicated to ongoing progress in this field. 2.2 Challenges in the delivery and development of vaccine products There are many different types of vaccines on the market: live attenuated, inactivated, subunit, conjugate, and toxoid. Each of these types poses its own development challenges. The live attenuated and inactivated viral vaccines are the most complex, as they are most similar to a wild-type virus, making them generally highly immunogenic but also the most unstable of the vaccine modalities. Live virus vaccines (LVVs) are challenging to stabilize and often require a cold chain throughout their intended shelf life. Their complex structures lead to many possible degradation pathways (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, aggregation) that can be detrimental to drug product quality. It is difficult to elucidate what is occurring, since many of the characterization methods used to analyze proteins cannot resolve the complexities of viruses. Therefore, cell-based or binding assays are used as the primary indicator of stability, and the formulation development of LVVs is mostly performed empirically [14,15] and can be informed by the design of experiments. Furthermore, many LVVs are not stable in the liquid state for the 18\u201324 months of shelf life needed for a marketed product. They must be dried to limit degradation, and they must be stored and shipped under cold-chain conditions. It should be noted that a cold chain is required for maintaining stability, and this was particularly important for the highly sensitive oral polio vaccine. With this impetus in mind, the vaccine vial monitor (VVM) was introduced in the late 1990s to ensure the stability of vaccines at the time of use. These VVMs measure the cumulative heat exposure the vaccine has experienced from the time of manufacture to administration, and they provide a visual indicator to confirm for the end-user whether the vaccine is stable and can be used. The value of VVMs to the vaccine supply chain cannot be overstated. PATH (a nonprofit global health organization) stated that, for just a few cents more per vaccine, \u201cover the next decade, VVMs will allow workers to recognize and replace >200 million doses of damaged vaccine and to confidently deliver more than a billion more doses in remote settings \u2013 saving lives and reducing illness for countless people.\u201d [16]. Subunit and conjugate vaccines contain only one or a few proteins or polysaccharides, so they are less complex but usually require an adjuvant and multiple doses to elicit a durable immune response. Gardisil\u00ae9, for example, is a highly successful combination vaccine that provides >90% efficacy against cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). It was only recently approved for the prevention of certain HPV-related head and neck cancers [17]. It is supplied as a liquid in a vial or a prefilled syringe with a storage temperature of 2\u20138 \u00b0C. However, like the polio vaccine, Gardisil\u00ae9 is also sensitive to storage temperatures above 2\u20138 \u00b0C. The incorporation of these vaccines into solid dosage formulations can improve thermostability and will enable expanded access for hard-to-reach areas. More recently, DNA and RNA vaccines have entered the clinical evaluation stage. These vaccines must target the nucleus or cytoplasm, respectively, and they pose significant drug delivery challenges. Delivery vehicles such as viral vectors and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven attractive, but these delivery systems have their own inherent stability issues. The two in-use, emergently approved mRNA based vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines both illustrated the potential of mRNA vaccines, albeit with some side effects [18\u201321]. This serves a promising start for the mRNA vaccine platform and, despite the various unknowns surrounding COVID-19 vaccines, paves the way for the utilization of mRNA-based vaccines for prophylactic intervention in a pandemic situation. The urgent need for vaccines in improving human health outcomes is eminently obvious, especially in an epidemic or a pandemic outbreak, as exemplified by the ongoing efforts to prevent the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or to end the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. For example, rVSV-ZEBOV (Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA, USA) was advanced to clinical trials as a frozen vaccine. This accommodated the fast response time necessary to provide protection to healthcare workers and thus limited the spread of Ebola to surrounding areas [22]. In a landmark approval, ERVEBO\u00ae (Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA, USA) became the first FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of disease caused by the Zaire strain of Ebola in adult patient populations [23]. SARS-CoV-2 also started as an epidemic, and it is now considered the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. To prepare for a world after SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to find both therapeutic and prophylactic treatments in a relatively short time frame. Extensive knowledge of MERS-CoV vaccines coupled with recent advances in platform technologies (e.g., the mRNA platform, Oxford\u2019s ChAd, Symvivo\u2019s bacTRL technology) have allowed scientists to rapidly identify and construct SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [24]. As of early March 2021 [25], research and development is ongoing at over 100 vaccine manufacturers enabling over 180 clinical studies, with several studies in the Phase III stage [26]. The US has created Operation Warp Speed (OWS), a partnership of multiple agencies (i.e., the CDC, FDA, NIH, and BARDA) within the Health and Human Services Department. Their goal is the production of 300 million vaccine doses by January 2021 [25]. Promising countermeasures are being identified in an ongoing and accelerated manner through shared-cost initiatives and streamlined procedures for clinical trials and GMP manufacturing. A total of 14 vaccine candidates have been selected for acceleration, with the intent to narrow the list to a select few that will be advanced to large-scale randomized trials [27]. Phase 3 clinical trials were recently published by Pfizer [28] and Moderna [18,29], showing excellent promise for mRNA vaccines, both of which demonstrated efficacies >90%, ultimately leading to their approval in multiple countries across the globe. Submission to the FDA for an emergency use authorization (EUA) was met promptly, and now vaccination (and not vaccine) is the key critical path to saving lives. The Astra Zeneca-Oxford and Johnson & Johnson vaccines also gain emergency use authorization in multiple countries. Despite these advances on the clinical front, commercializing a vaccine is subject to many other requirements. Supply chain management is critical for these vaccines. For example, it is not known how many of these vaccines are stable in the liquid state or for how long; however, if drying is needed, extensive resources would be required for the conventional lyophilization of the billions of doses required for a pandemic. Speed-to-market places additional constraints on the development process; this has prompted the approval of suboptimal vaccine formulations for emergency use followed by a second-generation vaccine to provide the long-term stability needed for a robust supply. Besides supply chain constraints, innovative formulations and drug delivery approaches could afford improved access and broader outreach. Traditional and novel approaches for obtaining stable solid dosage forms, as well as the delivery of vaccines, are described below. 2.3 Current development progress in the industry Freeze-drying, or lyophilization, has been the primary means of drying vaccines since the mid-1900s, and it serves as the gold standard for obtaining a dry product. The literature provides details pertaining to the unit operations of freeze-drying and its application to biologics and vaccines [30,31]. In this review, we include a few key discussion topics related to delivery. The typical final presentation is a vial that requires reconstitution with a diluent before injection using a syringe and needle. To enable at-home delivery of lyophilized products, dual-chamber syringes and autopen injectors have been commercialized. In these devices, the lyophilized product is contained in one compartment, and the diluent is contained in the other compartment. This allows for rapid reconstitution and administration in a single step, but it significantly increases the unit cost. The use of spray drying has been another means for drying the drug substance, intermediates, and the drug product, but it has been limited primarily to small-molecule pharmaceuticals that are amenable to terminal sterilization. The approval of Raplixa\u00ae in 2015 as the first biologic manufactured using an aseptic spray-drying process may pave the way for the high-throughput manufacture of spray-dried vaccines. In addition, novel approaches for drying vaccines are also in various stages of development. Merck & Co., Inc. (West Point, PA), for example, has an existing agreement with EnWave Corporation, along with GEA Lyophil GmbH, to accelerate the exploration and potential commercialization of EnWave\u2019s radiant energy vacuum technology. This technology incorporates microwave energy to provide heat for sublimation, and it enables continuous processing to increase throughput compared to traditional lyophilization. Similarly, others in the industry are exploring Lyosphere technology as a flexible manufacturing platform. Lyosphere offers a process for drying vaccines (and other pharmaceuticals) in the form of small bead-like droplets (50\u2013550 \u03bcL). This provides stabilization through drying, which offers the ability to formulate biologics with high disaccharide content. The formation of discrete beads has many advantages, such as the ability to easily dispense doses for single- or multi-dose presentations by varying the number of beads dispensed. This process also has the potential to manufacture combination vaccines that target specific regions. For example, there are about 90 distinct serotypes of Streptococcus pneumonia, of which certain subsets are known to cause disease. However, their prevalence varies across the globe, and it differs between pediatric patients and adults patients [32]. One could envision the bulk manufacture of beads that target individual serotypes, followed by global distribution to decentralized filling lines. These entities would then customize combinations to meet the needs of particular regions or populations. This would allow for a more targeted method of reducing the disease burden and control costs. Another benefit is the flexibility to add or remove serotypes as etiologic agents change. Aside from formulation and manufacturing technologies, companies such as Merck & Co., Inc. (West Point, PA) are also exploring alternative drug delivery platforms (e.g., the transdermal delivery of vaccines). Microneedle array patches (MAPs), for example, are being assessed due to their potential for improved thermostability, ease of use, and self-administration. To incorporate vaccines into MAPs, the vaccine is either coated onto solid micro-projections, or it is formulated with excipients that are molded into projections that dissolve when administered to the skin (i.e., dissolvable MAPs). Thin films are similarly produced, and they have been shown to stabilize vaccines [33,34]. In all these cases, the vaccine formulations are typically dried by evaporation. Moisture content can be a problem, and additional drying or desiccation is generally needed to reduce the moisture content. Thin-film freeze-drying (TFFD) is a process of making thin films using freeze drying. This is an innovative approach to stabilize vaccines and biologics utilizing fast freezing and low air\u2013liquid surface tension, which results in films that are typically in the 1\u20132% moisture range. Alternative delivery approaches are also in various phases of development for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. For example, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is developing a transdermal patch that can be terminally sterilized [35]. Enesi Pharma has entered a collaboration with Imperial College London to develop RNA vaccines, including a SARS-CoV2 vaccine using their ImplaVax\u00ae technology to make solid dose vaccines that could eliminate the cold chain. Additionally, the first patients were administrated an oral tablet (Vaxart) [36] and a capsule (Symvivo) [37] in October and November 2020, respectively. A recent review by Ramirez et al. summarizes the challenges and requirements of an effective oral vaccine [38]. It would be a significant advantage if these vaccines could remain stable at room temperature and could be delivered through a noninvasive route since such vaccines could be manufactured in large quantities and distributed to areas that lack suitable cold-chain and healthcare infrastructures. Efforts have been made to relieve patients\u2019 pain from injections. Instead of switching administration routes, needle-free injection (NFI) technologies remove needles from the administration process and make it possible to inject formulations in the form of a dry powder. A solid-state needle-free injection requires this powder to have sufficient density (i.e., a density close to crystalline drugs), and it must also achieve a certain velocity to penetrate the skin when dosing [39,40]. PowderJect\u00ae is an excellent example of applying NFI technology to vaccines. Degano and colleagues coated gold particles with DNA, then they delivered the immunizing agent with PowderJect, powered by compressed helium [41]. Similar research has been reported by Chen, who prepared a dry powder by drying the vaccine solution (i.e., a solution containing the virus and trehalose) overnight, followed by grounding and sieving [42]. 2.4 Current development progress in academia Academia is also actively exploring novel formulations and delivery routes for vaccines to improve efficacy and patient outcomes. Several routes based on solid forms are being pursued, including microneedle patches, dry powders for inhalation, mucosal routes (e.g., nasal, pulmonary, sublingual, buccal), and other innovative formulations. 2.4.1 Microneedle arrays for transdermal delivery The tight semi-contiguous dendritic cell (DC) network in the skin has been identified as an attractive target for antigenic agents [43,44]. To target this network, several transdermal technologies have been explored for vaccine delivery. In particular, microneedle arrays have shown significant promise [45\u201348]. Microneedle arrays (MAs) are a minimally invasive delivery system that facilitates the transport of vaccines via the physical breaching of the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of the skin and is responsible for the skin\u2019s impermeability to most macromolecules, including vaccines [46]. MAs are manufactured as patches in a dry form that automatically reconstitutes upon penetration into skin [45]. Much progress has been made over the last few years to develop stable and efficacious vaccine MAs. For example, Prausnitz et al. explored >60 formulation matrices, and they find that carboxymethyl cellulose, trehalose\u2013sucrose, sucrose\u2013arginine, and arginine\u2013heptagluconate are particularly suited to prevent activity loss and improve the long-term stability of vaccine MAs [49\u201351]. Besides efforts in excipient screening, researchers have also tried to encapsulate antigens within nanoparticles (NPs). It has been demonstrated that NPs not only preserve the vaccine in MAs but also improve immune response [52]. In addition, NPs can be modified to achieve the controlled release of the vaccine or enhanced dendritic cell (DC) antigen uptake [53,54]. Niu et al. developed a hollow MA using ovalbumin as a model antigen and biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) NPs as a carrier. They demonstrated that their NP-based MA showed faster antibody affinity maturation kinetics and elicited significantly higher immune responses than antigen-loaded NPs delivered by intramuscular injection or soluble antigens delivered through hollow MAs [55]. The literature contains extensive demonstrations of the efficacy of vaccine MAs against pathogens of clinical interest (e.g., influenza, measles, HPV, polio) [55\u201361]. For example, Vaxxas NanopatchesTM are manufactured from silicon wafers and loaded with an unadjuvanted 9-valent recombinant HPV vaccine. This high-density array patch was similarly effective to using traditional intradermal administration in nonhuman primates [62]. 2.4.2 Dry powders and films for mucosal delivery Vaccines in solid form have also been developed for mucosal delivery routes, including nasal, pulmonary, ocular, vaginal, rectal, and buccal/sublingual [63]. As the largest lymphoid tissue in the human body, the mucosal immune system involves both systemic and local immune responses as well as both humoral and cellular immune responses. These dosage forms provide noninvasive alternatives to vaccine injections; at the same time, the solid state can serve to stabilize the vaccine in formulations. Inhalable pathogens deposit directly on the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract. Therefore, delivering a vaccine to the mucosal surface of the respiratory tract (including both the nasal and pulmonary mucosa) can be a direct path to efficient immunization and mimics the natural route of infection in many cases. For example, our group utilized TFFD technology to produce a stable vaccine in the form of a brittle powder with particle sizes in the inhalable range [64]. This TFFD-processed vaccine powder was shown to induce specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses after intranasal administration [65]. Another demonstration of intranasal vaccine powder was presented by Huang et al. They formulated whole inactivated influenza viruses as a dried powder through a combination of lyophilization and micro-ball milling. This powder elicited significant immune responses in a rat animal model when delivered intranasally [66]. Buccal and sublingual administration is also considered a promising route for delivering vaccines. Kraan et al. thoroughly discussed the advantages and disadvantages of sublingual/buccal delivery [67]. Demonstrations of the potential of buccal and sublingual vaccinations are well documented. For example, Murugappan et al. developed a whole inactivated virus vaccine for H5N1 as a sublingual tablet. They demonstrated that this vaccine remained active after both freeze-drying and tableting processes, and they showed that sublingual administration of the tablet is an effective route to prime influenza-specific immune responses against homologous and drifted variation [68]. Recently, Croyle et al. reported a thin-film delivery platform that preserves biologics and living organisms in ambient conditions. Their research demonstrated that administrating live influenza virus with the optimized film, by a sublingual or buccal route, induced humoral immune responses comparable to those achieved by intramuscular injection [34]. This platform is expected to be universally applicable to vaccines against various pathogens, and it could be one of the solutions to vaccinating against COVID-19. It should be noted that while mAbs are typically delivered in 1\u201310 mpk range, vaccines are often added in 10\u2013100 ug quantities to elicit the desired immune response, and thus loading of vaccines renders a challenge from a stability point of view instead of the amount to be loaded. 2.4.3 Other novel technologies for single-injection immunization Novel approaches are also being developed to enable the single-dose delivery of vaccines that traditionally must be administered multiple times to confer immunization. For example, McHugh et al. reported a microfabrication method, the stamped assembly of polymer layers (SEAL), which results in pulsed vaccine release to achieve a single-injection vaccination [69]. Their approach, which used tunable PLGA polymer layers, was shown to be less harmful to the tested antigens (i.e., an inactivated polio vaccine and ovalbumin) than the traditional emulsion-based microsphere encapsulation process [69]. In addition, Dellacherie et al. recently published work describing a single injection of a mesoporous silica micro-rod (MSR) vaccine that generated potent and durable humoral immunity [70]. In both cases, these technologies enable the manufacture and storage of vaccines in their dry form for optimal stability and shelf life, followed by reconstitution and injection at the time of use. 3 Gene and cell therapy products Gene therapy holds the promise of curing diseases caused by genetic defects. Compared to other biologic modalities, gene therapy is a relatively new field, with the first approved clinical trial performed by Rosenberg in 1990 [71]. The fundamental challenge of gene therapy is how to deliver the bulky and negatively charged DNA or RNA molecules through the cell membrane. For stable gene expression, the gene therapy product must also integrate or edit the chromosomal DNA to the targeted site. Viral vectors are the first solution for both challenges, since some viruses (e.g., retroviruses) can inject their cargo genes and integrate their genetic material into the chromosome. Besides gene therapy, viral vectors are also commonly used in cell therapy during the manufacturing process, such as in CAR-T therapy. Numerous viral vectors have also been evaluated for use in gene therapies, and the development of safe and efficient viral vectors for gene therapies is still an active area of research [72]. Some commonly used viruses for gene therapy include adenovirus, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), herpes simplex, retroviruses, and lentiviruses. To achieve stable gene expression, viral vectors must integrate the cargo sequence at the targeted location, and random integration may cause the activation of oncogenes [73]. Nonintegrating viruses can also be used to achieve stable gene editing effects by expressing the gene delivery systems. For example, an adenoviral vector can deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery to target specific genes in the chromosome [74]. Oncolytic virus therapy is a novel application of the therapeutic viral vector. As of November 2020, IMLYGIC\u00ae is the only FDA-approved oncolytic virus therapy on the market [75]. However, it is still difficult to predict the risks from the use of viral vector-based gene therapies. For example, the recent ASPIRO clinical trial of drug candidate AT132 caused three deaths, with progressive liver dysfunction occurring 3\u20134 weeks after dosing [76]. Gene therapy not based on viral vectors has become a rapidly growing field. This is especially true for oligonucleotide delivery. Oligonucleotides (including antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), miRNA, or siRNA) are typically <20 kDa or 30 bp in size. In many cases, these naked nucleic acids can achieve efficient permeation without delivery vehicles [77,78]. Conversely, delivering functional genes or gene editing machinery with mRNA or plasmid DNA (pDNA) requires a delivery system due to their large size and multiply-charged backbones [79,80]. The length of siRNA is typically 21\u201323 bp (approximately 15 kDa), while mRNA is in the order of hundreds to thousands of base pairs (e.g., the full-length CFTR mRNA is 6,128 bp) [81]. A wide variety of materials (e.g., lipids, PLGA, polyethylenimine (PEI)) have been explored as gene delivery vehicles. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most popular platform among all materials, with one approved drug on the market (Onpattro\u00ae) [82]. The design aspects of nanoparticles have been discussed in detail by Blanco, Shen, and Ferrari [83]. As we described previously, mRNA can also be used as vaccines, such as Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273 [84]. However, we should point out the key differences between mRNA vaccines and other therapeutic applications. In vaccines, immunogenicity is desired, so adjuvants are often added to boost the local immune response. In contrast, the immunogenicity of transient gene-silencing products should be minimized. Finally, a relatively uncommon application of nucleic acids is aptamers. As the nucleic acids\u2019 version of antibodies, aptamers can bind to specific target molecules in high affinity. Pegaptanib, approved by the FDA in 2004, is the only drug in this category on the market [85]. Gene therapy products differ only in their specific RNA or DNA sequence. Therefore, once an effective delivery and manufacturing platform is established, the subsequent development of products greatly accelerates. With the introduction of gene-editing systems, including zinc finger, TALEN, and the CRISPR Cas9 system, both viral and nonviral gene delivery systems can achieve stable gene expression. However, the potential risk of off-target editing remains when using stable gene therapies. Therefore, transient gene therapy, especially transient gene silencing through ASO, miRNA, or siRNA, is currently the most common approach on the market. However, gene silencing cannot restore the function of the defective genes in general, with the single exception of exon-skipping [86]. In many cases, messenger RNA delivery is still required to produce the therapeutic protein. Solid dosage forms of gene therapies can deliver genetic material to targeted organs, so they have potential applications in the treatment of chronic diseases that affect mainly one organ (e.g., cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease). Since nucleic acids and viruses are more stable in solid form than liquid form, using solid dosage forms can improve products\u2019 shelf-life and reduce the need for cold chain logistics. In this section, we will introduce both nonviral and viral gene delivery vehicles and the application of solid dosage forms in gene therapy. Besides gene therapy, pharmaceutical solids have potential applications in some emerging modalities such as cell therapy and phage therapy. Using solid forms mainly improves the stability and shelf-life of cell therapy products such as stem cells and CAR-T therapy. For bacteriophages, the solid dosage forms can not only improve stability but also enable the phage to be inhaled as a dry powder. 3.1 Challenges in the delivery and development of gene therapies Formulating gene therapy products into solid dosage forms could improve the shelf life of these products, reduce the cost of logistics, and enable noninvasive routes of administration. However, the nanoparticles used as gene delivery vehicles can aggregate during the freeze-drying process. Therefore, the lyoprotectant and freezing conditions should be selected carefully to prevent aggregation. Spray drying, on the other hand, can cause thermal decomposition of the genetic materials, so the spray drying of most gene therapy products can be performed only at very low temperatures and low flow rates to achieve acceptable water content without damaging the genetic material. For example, Jansen et al. prepared siRNA-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles in a dry powder for inhalation using a Buchi B290 spray dryer operating at 45 \u00b0C with a feed rate of 0.3 mL/min [87]. Compared to spray drying excipients alone for inhalation, similar aerosol performance can be achieved using the same spray dryer operating at 150 \u00b0C with a feed rate of 11.4 mL/min [88]. Therefore, the low processing rate indicates that spray drying gene therapy products will have higher costs than small-molecule products. Many oral drug delivery systems can target inflammation microenvironments such as in IBD [89]. By incorporating siRNA in nanoparticle delivery systems, Kang et al. also demonstrated that siRNA can be absorbed and targeted to the liver [90]. It is possible to use solid dosage forms to achieve site-specific drug release (e.g., targeting inflammation sites in the colon); however, as of November 2020, there is no research using controlled-released solid dosage forms for oral gene delivery. Since such concepts have already been explored in oral vaccine delivery, it should not be difficult to apply them to gene therapy [91]. Finally, most gene therapy products are designed to provide long-acting or permanent therapeutic outcomes; therefore, there is less demand for noninvasive routes of administration than with other biologics such as peptide drugs. 3.2 Development efforts toward solid dosage forms of gene therapies No commercial gene therapy products are administered as solid dosage forms, but the research in this area is promising. First, solid dosage forms allow for a wider range administration routes, including oral delivery and dry powder inhalation. Second, semisolids and implants can act as a controlled-release reservoir, which improves patient compliance and pharmacokinetic profiles. Third, solid dosage forms are usually more stable than liquid dosage forms; this is especially important for gene therapy products, since some of their formulations are colloids. In addition, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), Chapter 467, sets limits for residual solvents. The drying process used to prepare solid dosage forms can remove these residual solvents and other volatile impurities from the nanoparticle preparation [92,93]. This is difficult to achieve with liquid dosage forms. The most common methods used to prepare pharmaceutical solids for biologics are spray drying and freeze drying. Depending on the nature of the API, both physical and chemical degradation can occur during the drying process. The complexation of the negatively charged DNA or RNA with positively charged biocompatible materials has been proven to form a stable delivery system. It is also a useful strategy to mitigate degradation during the dehydration process. A study by Mohri et al. showed that naked pDNA is significantly degraded during spray-freeze drying, but this degradation can be inhibited by forming DNA\u2013chitosan complexes [94]. Similarly, cationic lipids such as 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammoniumpropane (DOTAP) can form protective pDNA\u2013lipid complexes for freeze-drying and spray drying [95]. Table 1 summarizes the solid formulations developed for various routes of administration of gene therapy modalities. 3.2.1 Inhalation delivery Spray-dried and freeze-dried powders can be used for inhalation using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) directly or after a milling process. In dry powder formulation, a carrier excipient is usually blended with the API to improve the aerosol performance. For freeze-dried nanoparticle formulations, the carrier can also serve as a lyoprotectant to prevent aggregation [102]. Most dry powder formulations evaluated for gene therapies are nonviral vector-based formulations, including siRNA [97], pDNA [94], and mRNA [96]. Note that for formulations using particulate drug delivery systems, the final solid drug loading is usually very low, generally in the range of 0.1% to 5% [94,96,97]. The low drug loading poses a significant challenge for dry powder inhalation because high powder amounts can induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness, particularly for patients with pulmonary conditions [103]. Although virus lyophilization has been performed widely in the vaccine industry, the use of virus dry powder formulations for inhalation remains rare. 3.2.2 Oral delivery As with most macromolecules, low bioavailability is the major challenge for oral gene therapies [104]. To make oral gene therapy products feasible, an integrated approach should be used, such as a combination of enteric-coated tablets and mucus-penetration nanoparticles. The enteric coating protects the API from degradation in the stomach. The coating then dissolves in the higher pH environment of the small intestine, releasing the nanoparticles to deliver their payload. This integrated approach could also be advantageous for targeted therapies. Interestingly, oral delivery of nanoparticle vehicles mainly alters the absorption and distribution properties of the API. For example, Khatun et al. tested the biodistribution of an orally administered nanoparticle formulation. They showed localization primarily in the jejunum and ileum regions of the small intestine 24 h after administration [105]. In contrast, Raoof et al. tested the biodistribution of orally administered free ASOs, and they observed almost no retention in the small intestine 24 h after administration [99]. In this study, the siRNA was tableted via wet granulation with sodium caprate to enhance permeation. Compared to the IV route, the bioavailability in plasma is 1.4%. Due to the increased accumulation of nanoparticles, tissue bioavailability is much higher (2.0% to 4.3%). These values are similar to oral semaglutide (0.4% to 1%) [106]. IBD is a particularly interesting disease for oral gene therapy because the inflammation sites have a pH of 2.3\u20135.5 (compared to the normal intestinal pH of 6.8\u20137.2) [104]. A current clinical trial for the local delivery of siRNA to lesion sites requires endoscopic submucosal injection, which is unfeasible for routine use [107]. Alternatively, using solid dosage forms such as enteric-coated tablets along with nanoparticles could achieve targeted but noninvasive delivery to these lesions. 3.2.3 Other solid dosage forms Besides oral and inhalation, other routes of administration are also possible for solid dosage forms. Scherer et al. reported on the design and implementation of implantable collagen sponges for gene delivery [108]. Suppositories for siRNA and pDNA delivery have also been documented [101,109], as have injectable matrices of calcium phosphate\u2013based cermet for the sustained release of DNA complexes [110]. 3.3 Cell therapy 3.3.1 Stem cell and cord blood Stem cell transplantation is an emerging field of regenerative medicine with a few FDA-approved products on the market. All of these are hematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from cord blood (e.g., Allocord, Clevecord, Ducord) [111]. All products in this category are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for shipping and storage, which is inconvenient and costly [112]. Solid dosage forms may allow these products to be stored in a normal freezer or refrigerator (at 2 \u00b0C to 8 \u00b0C or \u221220 \u00b0C to \u221230 \u00b0C). Data from a few preliminary studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal structures of mouse and human spermatozoa can be preserved after lyophilization and reconstitution [113\u2013115]. For example, Kawase et al. lyophilized mouse spermatozoa in ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid with a Tris buffer [113,114]. However, the sperm activity, measured by how quickly the zygote reaches the blastocyst stage, decreased rapidly after one month of storage at 4 \u00b0C and \u221220 \u00b0C [116]. The lyophilization of stem cells has also been explored. Di et al. showed that using trehalose as a cryoprotectant can maintain 70% of the viability of lyophilized human mesenchymal stem cells after three weeks of storage at 4 \u00b0C [116]. Some protein excipients may also help preserve stem cells during lyophilization. For example, the stress protein p26 was shown to provide a synergistic effect with trehalose for maintaining cell viability after lyophilization [117]. Protein excipients should be avoided due to concerns about their potential immunogenicity. However, more work is clearly needed to optimize the formulation and drying process to achieve the long-term stability of dried mammalian cell products [118,119]. 3.3.2 \u201cOff-the-shelf\u201d CAR-T In autologous chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, the patient\u2019s own T-cells are transduced ex vivo with the CAR gene and then transfused back to the patient as the therapeutic. One limitation of current autologous CAR-T platforms is that each dosage is customized to an individual patient, and several weeks are typically required before the patient can receive treatment. In the CAR-T industry, producing the viral vectors in large batches and sending these viral vectors to a hospital for other processes can reduce the cost of manufacturing and shipping [120]. One limiting factor of the viral vectors is the need to ship them in liquid nitrogen or at \u221280 \u00b0C. By lyophilizing the viral vectors, one can significantly reduce their shipping and storage costs. Currently, companies such as THERAVECTYS (Villejuif, France) have begun to explore the possibility of producing lentiviral vectors for clinical use [121,122]. \u201cOff-the-shelf\u201d or allogeneic CAR-T allows the CAR-T cells to be produced in large batches and shipped to various clinical sites, but storage and shelf life are inherently limiting challenges [123]. Similar to stem cells, allogeneic CAR-T therapies require cryopreservation for storage in the near-term. The development of solid dosage forms of CAR-T cells could eliminate harmful cryopreservation, extend shelf life, and improve transportation and handling. Therefore, CAR-T therapies hold the promise of expanding the application and usability of these breakthrough therapies. 3.4 Phage therapy Due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, phage therapy has been revived as an alternative to antibiotics. Phage therapy offers high specificity to the target strain, a good safety profile, and is straightforward to produce. Further, bacteriophages can coevolve with bacteria to delay the onset of resistance [124]. Insufficient shelf life continues to be a key challenge for phage therapy. However, powder formulations have already been shown to effectively maintain phage potency during long-term storage [125]. For example, Brown et al. developed a PEG-based troche formulation containing K. oxytoca, a phage that retained efficacy for less than two months when stored at 4 \u00b0C [126,127]. In contrast, a spray-dried formulation of the PEV61 phage retained potency for over 12 months under ambient conditions [128]. Another remaining challenge is the noninvasive delivery of phage therapies, which can be addressed using biological solids. The pulmonary delivery of host-bacteria targeting phages has been widely investigated due to the high incidence of lung infections in diseases such as cystic fibrosis and tuberculosis. However, the stress induced during the nebulization of liquid phage formulations has been shown to significantly reduce phage activity [129]. In contrast, phage activity can be retained when they are administered using dry powder inhalation [130]. For a more detailed discussion about dry-state phage formulations, please refer to a recently published review paper by Zhang et al. [131]. 4 Peptide products 4.1 Unique features of peptide molecules The length of an amino acid chain is the defining characteristic that distinguishes peptides from proteins [132]. We adopt the exclusion and inclusion criteria from Lau and Dunn, in which a peptide contains at least two amino acids linked by a peptide bond, recombinantly expressed peptides contain <50 amino acids, and synthetic peptides can have any length [133]. Peptides bridge the gap between proteins and small molecules. Peptide products have the same benefits and limitations as the development of proteins and small molecules, but peptides have unique advantages. Similar to small molecules, peptides can be chemically synthesized, and they are more flexible in the lead optimization process than their protein counterparts [134]. However, similar to proteins, peptides benefit from their high selectivity, potency, and their specific binding affinity with therapeutic targets. In addition, they show less toxicity than small molecules [135]. Peptides uniquely exhibit less antigenicity and immunogenicity than proteins, while conserving higher selectivity and potency than small molecules [136,137]. However, peptides, proteins, and some classes of small molecules (i.e., BCS Class III & IV) all suffer the same limited bioavailability due to enzymatic degradation, poor transport across membranes, or other stability-limiting characteristics. Peptides are larger than small molecules but less complex than proteins, since peptides lack higher order structure. The absence of complex folding exposes peptide side chains to the surrounding environment, making them vulnerable to oxidation, hydrolysis, and deamination [50]. Formulation conditions (e.g., pH, ionic strength, temperature) can impact the physical stability of peptides, and self-association tends to increase as concentration increases [132,138]. As a result, formulating products in the solid state is an obvious path to confer sufficient stability while eliminating cold-chain storage requirements [139]. 4.2 Challenges in the development and delivery of peptide products 4.2.1 Formulation obstacles to solution stability Peptide formulations for injection include multiple excipients that promote stability while the peptide is in solution. These include buffering and pH-adjusting agents, isotonicity agents, bulking agents or stabilizers, surfactants, antioxidants, chelators, and preservatives [132]. Excipient selection must improve solubility, prevent aggregation and oxidation, and inhibit microbial growth. When used in injectables, peptides must be completely solubilized to avoid complications. Peptides exhibit a strong pH-dependent solubility, which is minimal at the isoelectric point of the peptide. Therefore, buffers and pH-modifying agents are commonly used to maximize solubility by maintaining the desired pH, preferably in a tolerable range for injection (e.g., pH 3\u201310) [132,140,141]. Smaller volumes are required for intramuscular and subcutaneous injections (e.g., 1.5 mL) [142], and this typically results in concentrated peptide formulations. An increase in concentration promotes self-association, which can reduce potency [143\u2013145]. Bulking agents (e.g., sugars or sugar alcohols) can prevent aggregation through multiple interrelated mechanisms (e.g., the excluded volume effect). Amino acid salts have also been used, since they preferentially bind to hydrophobic regions to prevent peptide aggregation [138]. Additionally, peptides can be highly susceptible to oxidation, specifically peptides that include sulfur-containing amino acids (i.e., methionine or cysteine) [146]. Therefore, chelators and antioxidants are crucial to preserve peptide functionality. Injectable peptide products in a multidose vial must also (a) incorporate an antimicrobial agent effective against a wide range of microbes, (b) maintain activity throughout the life cycle of the product, and (c) have no effect on product quality or patient safety [147]. These demanding criteria limit their development. To date, only four preservatives have been approved for use in injectable peptide products: phenol, metacresol, benzyl alcohol, and chlorobutanol [148]. Due to these challenges, liquid peptide formulations require cold-chain storage to preserve peptide activity. 4.2.2 Formulation obstacles that compromise solid stability Solid formulations are not burdened by formulation stability to the same degree as peptides in solution; however, solid formulations still have their own hurdles to overcome before they can ensure that their potency is not compromised by excipient incompatibility or the manufacturing process [149]. For example, excipients that decrease the microenvironment pH when biological solids are administered can promote degradation via the hydrolysis of peptides that are sensitive to low pH [150]. In this example, optimizing the excipients for the peptide being developed and for the chosen administration route can prevent degradation, stabilize the secondary structure, and prevent oxidation [150,151]. Ideally, excipients for biological solids will exhibit a multipurpose functionality: (a) stabilizing the peptide and (b) promoting bioavailability when not delivered parenterally. Additionally, manufacturing operations can impart unique stressors that can compromise biologics\u2019 stability. In later sections, we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of various processing methods and excipients on peptide formulations in both industrial and academic settings. 4.2.3 Formulation obstacles that compromise bioavailability based on route of administration Peptides have difficulty crossing physiological barriers. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry has favored the injectable route: 78% of therapeutic peptide products are formulated as an injectable dosage form [127]. Injectable formulations also avoid enzymatic degradation in the GI tract due to low-pH environments, proteases, or peptidases [131]. Injectable routes accelerate formulation development because they have fewer barriers to overcome. However, injectable formulations come at the patient's expense, as injections are costly, invasive, and painful [133]. 4.2.3.1 Oral Increasing the ease of administration improves patient compliance with any product; therefore, oral products are preferred because they are noninvasive, painless, and convenient [7,8]. The development of solid oral formulations minimizes healthcare costs while increasing patient adherence. However, the delivery of peptides through the GI tract presents significant challenges. First, peptides are degraded into smaller chains or even individual amino acids in the GI tract [7]. Peptides are highly susceptible to proteolysis in the low-pH environment of the stomach [132,138,152]. Moreover, peptides are relatively insoluble in the GI tract (where the pH is often close to the peptide\u2019s isoelectric point) [149], and macromolecules such as peptides show poor permeability across the epithelial layer of the small intestine, further limiting bioavailability. To overcome the harsh environment of the GI tract, innovative formulations have incorporated novel excipients to promote stability. For example, peptidase inhibitors, pH modifiers, and enteric-coated polymers have been used to preserve peptide integrity during oral administration [153]. Approaches that are commonly used in small-molecule development have been adapted to peptides to improve their solubility. These methods include the use of surfactants, polymer nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, microemulsions, liposomes, and micelles [154\u2013161]. However, the most challenging obstacle for the oral delivery of peptides is attaining adequate systemic blood circulation levels due to (a) poor permeation across the intestine epithelial layer and (b) high first-pass clearance. Some peptides can enter systemic circulation via transporters [162\u2013165], but absorption generally requires the aid of permeation enhancers to disrupt the paracellular tight junctions [166,167]. Alternatively, mucoadhesive polymers (e.g., carbomers or chitosan) can increase the residence time of the peptide within the upper small intestine, thus promoting absorption [168,169]. Once in systemic circulation, peptides typically experience a high first-pass effect and are rapidly cleared by the kidneys due to their relatively low molecular weight. Unless the drug is extremely potent, the administration of multiple peptide tablets is required to sustain blood concentration levels. Further advances must leverage the collaboration of formulation scientists and medicinal chemists. 4.2.3.2 Inhalation Inhalation is a promising route of administration for drug delivery because it offers several advantages over other routes of administration. The lungs offer a large surface area for absorption, an extensive vascular network, the ultra-thin alveolar epithelium, and a high capacity for solute exchange [170]. Contrary to oral administration, inhalation delivery avoids first-pass metabolism and the low-pH environment of the GI tract [171,172]. Therefore, pulmonary drug delivery is used for local diseases such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as for systemic diseases such as diabetes, growth deficiency, osteoporosis, or viral infections. The pulmonary route can be utilized to deliver drugs in the liquid state as a nebulized formulation or as a solution/suspension within a meter-dosed formulation. However, dry powder products are the preferred means of delivering therapeutics to the lungs. Though pulmonary delivery bypasses many of the challenges encountered with oral delivery, inhaled formulations still have challenges of their own. The extent and location of drug deposition depends largely on particle size and the velocity of the inspiratory flow; therefore, larger particles (i.e., particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter > 5 \u03bcm) deposit in the conducting airways while smaller particles (1\u20135 \u03bcm) deposit on the alveolar surface [170,173]. Another consideration is the lung microenvironment, which is rich in peptidases that can degrade therapeutic peptides. Pulmonary peptidases (e.g., elastase, collagenase, angiotensin-converting enzymes) decrease the bioavailability of inhaled products [174,175]. Depending on the peptide\u2019s susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, incorporating inhibitors (e.g., nafamostat mesylate, bacitracin, chymostatin) can be a viable way to increase bioavailability [172,176,177]. When the peptide reaches the surface of the alveoli, its absorption pathway is determined by its concentration and size. Peptides are predominantly absorbed via the paracellular pathway, which is the transport of the peptide through junctions between two or more cells [178,179]. Similar to oral delivery, solid inhaled formulations in the dry state are less susceptible to shear-induced denaturation and less susceptible to hydrolysis or deamidation due to temperature or pH [6]. Several particle engineering techniques are well suited to prepare peptide powders with sufficient aerodynamic properties. These techniques include milling, freeze drying, spray drying, spray-freeze drying, TFFD and supercritical fluid technologies. Each processing technique applies unique stressors to the composition that must be considered during process development. 4.2.3.3 Buccal Although less explored, buccal delivery is also a viable route for the noninvasive delivery of biological solids. Similar to inhalation, buccal delivery avoids the first-pass effect and the low-pH environment of the GI tract. In addition, the buccal mucosal membrane is more permeable than other mucosal membranes [180]. To enter systemic circulation, the peptide must be transported across both the mucosal layer and the epithelial layer, which is <800 \u03bcm thick [181]. However, buccal delivery is limited by its low surface area, which limits absorption and requires higher peptide concentrations [182]. Additionally, buccal delivery brings non-barrier challenges such as taste, mucosal irritation, dilution by saliva, and even accidental swallowing [182\u2013184]. Currently, there are no approved solid dosage forms for buccal peptide delivery, and only a limited number are in clinical trials [184]. 4.3 Current development progress in industry To date, only four approved oral peptide products act systemically. Two of these were approved in the early 1970 s (i.e., cyclosporin and desmopressin). In this review of progress in the industry, only novel solid formulations are discussed, with less emphasis on common lyophilized products. 4.3.1 Permeation enhancers The multiple avenues of peptide degradation during oral delivery require the engineering of complex dosage systems. These dosage systems must evade the harsh pH of the stomach and the proteases of the small intestine while overcoming low permeability. Thus, the oral solid dosage form of peptides remains challenging. For example, the oral delivery technology Peptelligence\u2122 was designed to deliver salmon calcitonin (sCT, a 32-amino acid peptide for osteoporosis) loaded into citric acid\u2013based vesicles in an enteric-coated tablet. This tablet promotes vesicle release in the small intestine, and the citric acid\u2013based vesicles modulate the microenvironment to protect the sCT from peptidases. Although sCT was shown to be delivered to the site of action without immediate degradation, this technology could not address poor sCT permeation. Blood peptide concentrations were inadequate to achieve primary outcomes, resulting in the technology receiving a complete response letter from the FDA. Peptelligence\u2122 exemplifies the hurdles of oral peptide delivery. In this case, the peptide was protected from degradation, but adequate blood concentrations could not be achieved due to the poor intrinsic permeability of sCT and a lack of effective permeation enhancers. Recently, two peptide products have received FDA approval for oral administration: semaglutide in September 2019 and octreotide in June 2020 [185,186]. Semaglutide, a peptide hormone composed of 30-amino acids, is a glucagon-like-peptide-1 analog indicated for type 2 diabetes. It is marketed as Rybelsus\u00ae by Novo Nordisk. Octreotide, a cyclic octapeptide hormone, is a somatostatin analog indicated for acromegaly. It is marketed as MYCAPSSA\u00ae by Chiasma, Inc. [185,186]. The MYCAPSSA formulation does not fall within the scope of this paper, since it is an oil-based suspension in capsule form. However, the novelty of this formulation warrants a brief discussion to better understand the development of oral peptide delivery in the industry. Oral octreotide utilizes transient permeation technology in which octreotide is added to an aqueous buffer containing the permeation enhancer sodium caprylate (C8). The formulation is then lyophilized and suspended in oil inside an enteric-coated gelatin capsule [187]. This enteric capsule prevents octreotide from being released in the stomach. The small cyclic structure of octreotide (with a molecular weight of 1,020 Da) prevents peptidase degradation, and the permeation enhancer (C8) promotes systemic octreotide absorption [187,188]. As a result, a 20 mg oral dose achieved a similar AUC and a Cmax that was 66% as high as a 0.1 mg subcutaneous injection [185]. In Chiasma\u2019s patent application, the composition studied contained between 0.058 and 1.357% w/w octreotide [189]. Rybelsus is a combination of peptide engineering and the incorporation of a permeation enhancer. It also allows sufficient clinical outcomes with oral delivery. Novo Nordisk determined that the addition of C18 diacid maximized GLP-1 potency, while the amino acid substitution at position 8 from alanine (ALA) of 8ALA to aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) provided resistance to DPP-IV cleavage and increased GLP-1 affinity [190,191]. The introduction of unnatural amino acids or backbone modification can significantly extend the peptide stability in serum [192]. In this case, these structural modifications alone increased the half-life of semaglutide to one week [186]. Additionally, Rybelsus incorporates a permeation enhancer, salcaprozate sodium (SNAC), to achieve therapeutic blood peptide concentrations. Interestingly, Rybelsus does not utilize an enteric coating, and absorption occurs primarily in the stomach (see package insert) [186]. To overcome degradation in the stomach, this formulation was designed to release large amounts of SNAC (e.g., 300 mg) simultaneously with semaglutide. In addition to serving as a permeation enhancer, SNAC provides local pH elevation in the vicinity of the tablet, thus inhibiting pepsin activity [193]. In Novo Nordisk\u2019s patent application, the optimal formulation, composition E, contained 3.75% w/w semaglutide and 75% w/w SNAC [194]. Further increasing the amount of semaglutide or SNAC showed minimal improvements in bioavailability [194]. The success of Rybelsus and MYCAPSSA, and the failure of Peptelligence\u2122, demonstrates that permeation enhancers are critical excipients for oral solid dosage peptide delivery [195]. However, more study is certainly needed. For example, a liraglutide\u2013SNAC formulation did not achieve similar absorption. Similarly, formulating semaglutide with a different permeation enhancer did not achieve similar absorption [196]. Together, these findings highlight the importance of considering the specific interactions between a peptide and its excipients to enable successful oral peptide delivery. 4.3.2 Hot-melt extrusion The limited thermal and shear stability of peptides limits the range of possible processing techniques [197]. For example, hot-melt extrusion (HME) requires temperatures above the carrier glass transition temperature (Tg) and involves residence times on the order of minutes, which can be detrimental to peptides. Encapsulating peptides in biodegradable polymers can help protect peptides from thermal and shear stresses. Specifically, PLGAs and related polymers can extend the duration of a peptide\u2019s action by up to 6 months in a solid dosage form [198]. Further, the ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid in PLGA polymers dictates the glass transition temperature (which can range from 40 to 60 \u00b0C) and can be tuned to enable the hot-melt extrusion of peptides [199]. For example, the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) goserelin acetate, marketed as Zoladex\u00ae by AstraZeneca, highlights this unique processing technique [200]. As described in the related patent, goserelin acetate (a synthetic decapeptide) is dissolved with PLGA in glacial acetic acid where it can be frozen, dropwise, in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized [201]. The resulting composition, which encapsulates the 30% w/w goserelin within PLGA, can then be extruded to form thin rods for implantation without impacting the activity of the goserelin [201]. Zoladex\u00ae was approved in 1996, but it remains a novel case to consider for future peptide formulations and processing. This product highlights the ability of certain peptides to tolerate elevated temperatures and high shear stresses for prolonged periods of time. It also highlights the approaches used to mitigate the thermal and shear stresses required for processing. As new technologies emerge (e.g., 3-dimensional printing), peptides that can exhibit similar heat tolerance are viable candidates for these new applications. Additional development hurdles of biological implant\u2019s safety are minimizing the \u201cburst\u201d release while ensuring continuous release for the duration of the implant [202]. 4.4 Current development progress in academia The novel formulations and manufacturing techniques generated in the academic setting have the potential to overcome the limitations currently seen in the industrial setting. Understanding the current status of peptide formulations in academia provides some insight into future industrial methods to enhance peptide delivery. 4.4.1 3-Dimensional printing Many formulation processes adapted for pharmaceutical applications have been repurposed from other industries (e.g., spray drying, hot-melt extrusion). Recently, 3-dimensional (3-D) printing has emerged as a novel processing technique for small-molecule delivery [203,204]. The feasibility of using 3-D printing to incorporate peptides has been demonstrated by the development of scaffolds that promote tissue regeneration [205] and by incorporating vancomycin, a glycopeptide, into medical devices [206]. For example, Wang et al. developed a tissue scaffold using microextrusion 3-D printing with black phosphorous, beta-tricalcium phosphate, PLGA, doxorubicin, and a hydrophilic osteogenic peptide. Microextrusion 3-D printing is one of the many additive manufacturing methods that generate bottom-up 3-D materials [207]. This process utilizes a mechanical drive, typically a piston or screw, in conjunction with a computer-controlled robotic platform to continuously deposit filaments on a substrate [208]. Unlike filament deposition, microextrusion does not require external heat, making it favorable for peptide formulations. However, microextrusion is limited by the solution viscosity it can deposit [208]; the composition must be viscous enough to maintain its shape after deposition but not too viscous to allow for continuous filament deposition. To address this limitation, Wang et al. utilized a cryogenic substrate surface to maintain scaffold integrity [205]. They showed that their modified microextrusion process can create precise scaffolds that incorporate evenly distributed amounts of stable peptide, while the PLGA component allows for controlled erosion over time to gradually release the osteogenic peptide and promote tissue regeneration over three months [205]. Additionally, in a 2015 patent application, inventors showed the feasibility of using selective laser sintering (SLS), a powder bed fusion additive manufacturing technique, to produce medical implants containing the glycopeptide vancomycin [206]. SLS is a solvent-free process that utilizes a laser to apply energy to a composition, where it then sinters together to form a final pharmaceutical dosage form in the solid state. Here, the inventors demonstrated the ability to incorporate 2% w/w and 5% w/w vancomycin in polylactide (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) granules. Though neither of these two examples utilized 3-D printing for conventional peptide delivery routes (i.e., IV infusion, oral, or inhalation), they highlight the potential of further investigation. Both 3-D printing processes mentioned above have their respective advantages and limitations that could be adapted for peptide drug delivery. The microextrusion method does not require exposure to elevated temperatures, but it does expose the peptide to solvents. In contrast, the SLS process does not expose the peptide to solvents, but it does require exposure to elevated temperatures. 4.4.2 Jet milling As previously discussed, particle size is a critical factor for successful inhalation delivery. To achieve appropriate particle size, micronizing technologies such as milling, spray-drying, supercritical fluid precipitation, and fast-freeze-drying have been used to reduce protein and peptide particle size [209\u2013213]. In particular, it is difficult to reduce the particle size of drugs with larger molecular weights, due to their ductile texture and their susceptibility to liquid\u2013air interfacial tension, pH, and temperature stresses [214]. In addition, due to their sensitivity to shear and other mechanical stresses, milling is usually not considered the ideal technology for micronizing these molecules. However, peptides might be an exemption due to their relatively simpler and more stable structure. Zhang et al. reported an excipient-free, stable, peptide dry powder inhalation (DPI) formulation utilizing jet milling to micronize the peptide bulk powder to particle sizes in the respirable range. They demonstrated that this short peptide maintained the stability merit of small molecules by withstanding the high shear stress generated by the fluid energy mill. Additionally, jet milling allowed the elimination of solvents and excipients [132]. Notably, additives such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) are added as counterions during the purification process of peptides and proteins [215]. The residual chemicals in the solid dosage forms should also be considered, since these substances might cause irritation or other adverse effects. For example, if a powder that contains a residual chemical is milled and directly utilized for pulmonary delivery, it might cause irritation to the lung, which has a low buffering capacity. 4.4.3 Spray drying Spray drying offers a highly controllable single-step process to systematically engineer particles with specific morphologies and sizes in the solid state [216]. In contrast, lyophilization, the industry standard for solid peptide formulations, is a two-step process that must be extensively optimized to account for ice formation stress, the freeze concentration of solutes, and pH swings when forming the powder. At the same time, the secondary milling step affords limited control over particle properties such as morphology, porosity, and particle size. However, the spray-drying process exerts thermal stress on the product. This the major barrier for processing thermally sensitive peptides [217]. To date, the processing of proteins using spray drying has been investigated, but only minimal attention is given to generating solid peptide formulations [217]. Nonetheless, careful parameters and excipient selection can overcome the destabilization or degradation of thermolabile peptides, making spray drying a viable candidate for engineering solid particles for inhalation delivery. Critical process parameters include maintaining the outlet temperature below the thermal degradation temperature of the peptide in solution. Concurrently, critical formulation parameters include the selection of a solvent with an evaporation temperature below the thermal degradation temperature of the peptide in solution [217]. For example, Zhou et al. formulated an excipient-free colistin formulation for DPI using spray drying [218]. The final solid particles had corrugated surfaces, which decreased the contact surface area. This decreased cohesive forces and ultimately increased aerosolization efficiency [218,219]. Another limitation of spray-dried formulations is the formation of amorphous or partially amorphous products. The amorphous state has increased hygroscopicity, which can impact peptide stability, crystallinity, and aerosol performance after storage [220,221]. In the same study, Zhou et al. demonstrated the stability of colistin in its amorphous form with no change in crystallinity. However, decreases in aerosol efficiency were seen only when the relative humidity was above 75%. This was attributed to stronger agglomeration [218]. In spray drying, several factors affect the properties of the powder: the excipient(s) and their ratio, the peptide-to-excipient ratio, solid content in the feed solution, the inlet and outlet temperature, the feed rate, and the atomizing air pressure [218]. All these parameters are interrelated; therefore, each formulation requires a unique optimization of multiple spray-drying parameters [218]. Zijlstra et al. argue that the spray-drying technique should be tuned to fit the characteristics of the formulation being investigated along with its intended application [222]. In their inaugural study investigating various techniques for micronizing the peptide cetrorelix for a DPI product, the spray-dried particles did not sacrifice purity. They produced particles with the highest specific surface area with aerosolization properties similar to milled and spray-freeze-dried particles [222]. 5 Protein products Therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) comprise the majority of the biologics currently approved and in clinical development [2], and they play a significant role in almost every field of medicine [223]. They possess high disease specificity and superior therapeutic activity due to their structural complexity [224]. Currently, mAbs are the majority class of newly developed drugs due to their attractive features (e.g., high potency, high specificity, targeting ability, low toxicity, few side effects) [225]. They are approved for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, migraines, and HIV infection [226]. In 2019, nearly 21% of all drugs approved by the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) were proteins (i.e., mAbs, antibody drug conjugates, fusion proteins, and nanobodies) [227]. In 2018, the global mAb market was valued at about USD 115.2 billion and is expected to grow to USD 300 billion by 2025 [226]. In 2019, six of the top ten best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market were mAbs, and they are expected to continue to capture market share in the future. 5.1 Unique features of protein molecules In vitro and in vivo instability, as well as poor transport across biological membranes, are persistent barriers to realizing protein therapeutics\u2019 full potential [228]. Proteins can undergo degradation when they are subjected to high temperatures, freezing and thawing, light, pH extremes, agitation, or shear [229]. Proteins adsorbing to surfaces at low concentrations and aggregating at high concentrations are also issues [229]. Proteins are also susceptible to acidic and enzymatic degradation in the GI tract, thus they exhibit inadequate stability after oral administration [186,200]. Therapeutic proteins\u2019 high molecular weight and hydrophilicity also limit their absorption and membrane permeability [230]. Thus, the administration of most therapeutic proteins occurs via the parenteral route [223]. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are an interesting class of therapeutic proteins that have provided treatment options for a variety of unmet medical needs. These molecules are large (i.e., a typical molecular weight is ~ 150 kDa) and complex, but their biological effects are predictable due to their high molecular target specificity [231]. Most marketed mAbs are IgG1 or IgG4 molecules that can initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [225]. Human IgG has a prolonged plasma half-life (i.e., days or weeks), which minimizes the frequency of administration and thus improves patient compliance [231]. Table 2 shows all the therapeutic proteins approved in 2019 by the FDA\u2019s CDER, of which 40% were mAbs [227]. In addition, the formulation of immunoconjugates (e.g., antibody\u2013drug conjugates (ADC) and antibody\u2013radionuclide conjugates) has greatly increased the utility of this interesting class of therapeutic proteins. 5.2 Challenges in the delivery and development of protein products 5.2.1 Formulation obstacles to solution stability James et al. define protein solution stability as the ability of protein molecules to resist aggregation by means of self-association [232]. Aggregation is influenced by the solution pH, salt type, salt concentration, and protein structure [232]. Liquid mAb formulations have additional stability problems. These include (a) the oxidation of Fc methionine residues, (b) the deamidation of glutamine and asparagine residues, (c) the isomerization of aspartic acid residues, and (d) fragmentation via hinge region cleavage [229]. Degradation events can be minimized by identifying the optimal pH, buffer system, and excipients. Solid dosage forms can help mitigate degradation, since the degradations mentioned above are either induced or exacerbated by water. The viscosity of high-concentration antibody formulations (i.e., \u2265100 mg/mL) can also present delivery challenges [233]. Interestingly, Bowen et al. reported the formulation of an mAb powder suspended in a nonaqueous solution. This powder suspension showed reduced viscosity and thus enhanced injectability compared to an aqueous solution with the same antibody concentration [233]. In fact, this spray-dried mAb powder suspended in ethyl lactate showed low viscosity (<20 cP) and good injectability at mAb concentrations up to 333 mg/mL [233]. 5.2.2 Formulation obstacles to bioavailability In academia and in the industry, major research seeks to develop novel strategies for the delivery of biologics via noninvasive routes (i.e., oral, buccal, nasal, transdermal, and pulmonary routes) or merely less invasive routes. For example, the subcutaneous route is more convenient than the intravenous route [4]. However, each of these convenient routes faces specific barriers and challenges. 5.2.2.1 Oral delivery Oral delivery of therapeutic proteins is challenging due to their inadequate stability in the GI tract [229]. This route also faces two main biological barriers: the thick intestinal mucus layer and the underlying epithelium [230]. Intestinal mucus can reduce diffusion or even trap the therapeutic protein, thus limiting its interaction with the intestinal epithelium [4]. Like most macromolecules, therapeutic proteins exhibit poor transport across the intestinal epithelium even when presented at high concentrations. Additionally, bile salts, gastric acid, or proteases can inactivate therapeutic proteins. Other challenges include the microbiome and first-pass metabolism, which reduce the efficacy of biologics administered via the oral route [4]. Therapeutic mAbs encounter an additional challenge of reduced uptake after oral administration due to competition from endogenous antibodies (203). Similar to peptide oral delivery strategies, enteric-coated tablets and capsules offer a solution to some of these challenges. The pharmaceutical industry has widely employed enteric-coated tablets and capsules for the oral administration of locally acting therapeutic proteins (i.e., digestive enzymes). For example, there are five FDA-approved products of pancrelipase, which is a mixture of pancreatic enzymes (including lipases, proteases, and amylases) derived from porcine pancreatic glands. It is currently available on the market in various dosage forms for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [234]. These products include delayed-release capsules (e.g., Creon\u00ae, Pertzye\u00ae, Zenpep\u00ae, and Pancreaze\u00ae) and immediate-release tablets (e.g., Viokace\u00ae). When taken properly with food, pancrelipase can last for ~ 1 h to aid digestion in the duodenum and the proximal small intestine [235]. The local site of pancrelipase action coupled with the use of enteric coatings overcomes many obstacles to oral protein delivery. Systemic uptake of therapeutic proteins after oral administration could be achieved via GI-tract sustainable vehicles, such as varieties of nanoparticles that include mucus-penetrating nanocarriers. These nanocarriers are typically designed with either a neutral hydrophilic surface (e.g., polyethylene glycol) or a positively charged surface (e.g., liposomes). For example, cationic polymers such as chitosan have been shown to enhance nanoparticle intestinal permeability, resulting in improved oral bioavailability of the loaded therapeutic proteins [236]. The hydrophobicity of quaternized N-aryl chitosan derivatives enhances the paracellular transport of macromolecules via tight junction opening. Thus, freeze-dried nanoparticles synthetized from quaternized N-aryl chitosan derivatives significantly enhanced the intestinal absorption of insulin [237]. Freeze-dried insulin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were reported to be more stable in the intestinal lumen compared to non-freeze-dried nanoparticles [238]. Recently, Muntoni et al. investigated the potential of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) in enhancing the oral delivery of glargine insulin [239]. An oleic acid/stearic acid\u2013based NLC suspension loaded with glargine insulin was processed into a dry powder by either freeze drying or spray drying. This powder was loaded into gelatin capsules or directly compressed into tablets. Glargine insulin\u2013loaded capsules and tablets showed a blood glucose lowering effect in healthy male Wistar rats. This was attributed to the absorption enhancing effect of oleic acid. 5.2.2.2 Inhalation Pulmonary administration may be the most promising near-term, noninvasive route for systemic protein delivery, as evidenced by the approval of two dry powders for insulin delivery via inhalation (i.e., Exubera\u00ae (August 2006 to October 2007) and Afrezza\u00ae (2015 to present)) [236,240,241]. The lung has unique features that facilitate the absorption of therapeutic proteins into systemic circulation: its large surface area for drug absorption (~75\u2013100 m2), high vascularization, high blood flow (5 L/min), and the ultra-thin alveolar epithelium (~0.1\u20130.5 \u00b5m thick) [241,243]. The tight junctions of alveolar type I cells and endothelial junctions have a pore size cutoff of 0.6 nm and 4\u20136 nm, respectively, which could allow for the paracellular transport of certain protein molecules [244]. Thus, therapeutic proteins can achieve systemic bioavailability after oral inhalation in the absence of permeation enhancers [245,246]. However, the mechanism of protein transport across the alveolar epithelium is protein specific and involves other routes such as receptor-mediated transcytosis [247]. Antibodies can reach systemic circulation after their inhalation, either as liquid or dry powder formulations, via uptake by mucosal Fc receptors [229]. Moreover, the pulmonary epithelium has low enzymatic activity and reduced function of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein [245,248]. However, the lung lining fluid still contains peptidases, which can degrade peptides that have a molecular weight < 3 kDa [249]. Proteins that reach the lung alveoli are also exposed to inactivation by the inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators (e.g., proteases) secreted by alveolar macrophages [244]. Nonetheless, proteins with a molecular weight > 10\u201350 kDa are more resistant to enzymatic degradation than smaller peptides, thus inhalation is a promising route for the delivery of therapeutic proteins, including antibodies. If a therapeutic protein is considerably stable in a liquid formulation, then nebulizers are the device of choice for its delivery to the lung via atomization [246]. About 75% of inhaled therapeutic proteins in clinical development are designed as liquid formulations for administration by nebulization [250]. Nebulization avoids the additional drying steps required for the development of dry powders. It also achieves high lung deposition and is appropriate for many clinical situations [250]. However, nebulizers are bulky and costly, and they usually require an external power source, a long administration time, and well-trained personnel [251]. Stress encountered during nebulization can also result in protein unfolding and aggregation with a consequent loss of activity [246]. For example, studies using fluorescence microscopy and dynamic light scattering have detected the formation of nebulization-induced visible and subvisible protein aggregates [252]. The nebulization of concentrated protein solutions is also challenging due to a low output rate (i.e., <0.1 g/min) caused by high viscosity (> 5cP), which leads to long administration times [253]. Moreover, solvent loss during nebulization can destabilize the protein before deposition in the lungs [254]. Various strategies have been investigated to protect therapeutic proteins from denaturation during nebulization. These include formulation strategies (e.g., the use of excipients and nanocarriers that protect against nebulization-induced protein aggregation) [252,254,255] and novel devices (e.g., surface acoustic wave microfluidic nebulizers) [256]. In contrast, the formulation of therapeutic proteins as dry powders for inhalation has several advantages over aqueous solution-based formulations. These include chemical and storage stability, a low risk of microbial growth, and an absence of preservatives and propellants [257,258]. The stabilized dry protein powder can be inhaled using a portable inhaler device (e.g., DreamBoat for inhaled insulin). DPIs reduce dosing time; thus they are more convenient for patients than traditional nebulizers [241,251]. Perhaps more importantly, the formulation of therapeutic proteins as dry powders avoids the stress-induced denaturation encountered during nebulization [251]. Crystalline APIs are preferred by the pharmaceutical industry for the formulation of inhaled powders due to their high purity and stability. Consequently, all marketed drug products for asthma and COPD are based on crystalline APIs [245]. However, crystalline APIs can be rapidly cleared from the lung by mucociliary clearance and macrophage phagocytosis due to their slow dissolution rate [258]. The slow dissolution of inhaled therapeutic proteins can also result in the formation of amyloid structures at the air\u2013tissue interface of the lung, thus reducing pulmonary airflow [248,259]. Amorphous dry powder inhalation formulations and some rapidly dissolving crystalline powders (e.g., Technosphere\u00ae particles) have allowed for the rapid dissolution and absorption of peptide and protein therapeutics (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1 or insulin) from the lung into systemic circulation [240,260,261]. Dry powder formulations of therapeutic proteins are usually amorphous solids [245]. Amorphous dry powders for inhalation dissolve faster in the alveolar aqueous mucus layer, which avoids rapid clearance by the lung\u2019s natural clearance mechanisms and achieves high bioavailability of the loaded therapeutic protein. However, amorphous solids can undergo crystallization during storage, especially at high relative humidity [258]. Crystallization has a deleterious effect on protein stability and aerosolization efficiency [262,263]. The degree of crystallization could be reduced by the addition of functional excipients and the use of moisture-protective packaging. Glass-forming excipients can stabilize proteins in the solid state by forming a glassy matrix [245]. Based on the FDA database of excipients for approved drug products, only ~ 12% of these excipients are approved for inhalation [258]. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel excipients with acceptable safety profiles or approve existing excipients that can maintain amorphous proteins\u2019 biological activity and stability for administration via the pulmonary route. An alternative strategy is the development of more stable excipient-free amorphous powders for inhalation that can also reduce the powder mass to be inhaled as well as alleviate possible side effects [264]. For instance, spray-dried, excipient-free insulin dry powder efficiently reduced blood glucose levels (to levels comparable to Afrezza\u00ae) after intratracheal insufflation [265]. However, it could be challenging for proteins with more complex structures, since dehydration stress can be detrimental and thus a stabilizing excipient is required to replace water molecules in order to preserve the proteins\u2019 structure [266]. Determining the protein dose is another challenge for the development of inhaled powders for therapeutic proteins. Unlike conventional drugs for pulmonary diseases such as asthma and COPD, which are delivered to the lung in microgram doses, the doses of protein therapeutics are usually larger. For example, the insulin content of Afrezza\u00ae is 0.35, 0.7, or 1 mg, and the insulin content of Exubera\u00ae is 1 or 3 mg [267]. High-dose formulations contain many fine particles with strong cohesive forces as well as amplified hygroscopicity [267]. Hence, these formulations show increased agglomeration due to particle\u2013particle cohesion, and they show poor flowability and aerosol dispersion due to particle\u2013inhaler wall adhesion. The pulmonary delivery of high drug doses is also challenging in terms of uniform delivery. This requires special formulation strategies and specific inhaler designs [267]. The first formulation strategy is the addition of larger carrier particles (e.g., lactose, mannitol, glucose) or force-controlling agents (e.g., magnesium stearate) that reduce tensile strength [267]. Another strategy is particle engineering using spray drying, spray-freeze-drying, or supercritical fluid technology to control particle morphology and size distribution. One example of this strategy is the production of PulmoSphere\u2122 particles using the spray-drying technique [267,268]. The liquid feed of PulmoSphere\u2122 formulations is composed of an oil-in-water emulsion. During spray drying, the aqueous and oil phases evaporate, resulting in the desired porous, sponge-like particles [268]. Incorporating large amounts of excipients in high dose formulations is discouraged due to potential long-term safety concerns [269]. Additionally, delivering fine carrier particles can affect patient compliance by provoking irritation, cough, and bronchoconstriction [270]. Cough can also be triggered by other factors, including the API, excipient, type of DPI, and formulation characteristics [271]. The risk of cough increases at nominal doses > 10 mg (particularly approaching 100 mg); however, high doses of dry powders do not necessarily cause other respiratory irritation [272]. Researchers should also consider the deleterious effects of the chronic exposure of the alveolar epithelium and the underlying connective tissue to a biologically active protein [259]. For instance, insulin was reported to be associated with small, consistent reductions in lung function. Insulin can act as a weak growth factor that enhances cell proliferation and connective tissue deposition; thus, it could increase the progression of lung cancer [264]. This is not a major problem for inhaled mAb powders, since mAb therapeutics are usually dosed less frequently due to their long plasma half-lives. This is unlike insulin, which requires daily frequent doses. Still, reducing the lung residence time of protein therapeutics by accelerating their absorption into systemic circulation could be an excellent strategy to alleviate their side effects [258,264]. 5.3 Current development progress in industry There are strong incentives for the development of therapeutic protein formulations that are stable at room temperature and allow excursions and delivery via noninvasive routes of administration. The following discussion reviews representative examples of dry powder\u2013based protein products, with a special emphasis on those products intended for noninvasive administration. Lessons learned from the development of these products will support formulation scientists in designing new formulation strategies for the administration of therapeutic proteins and mAbs. For cases in which no products exist, we will discuss the recent strategies used to develop new products. 5.3.1 Inhaled mAbs Most marketed therapeutic mAbs are administered via injection to achieve high systemic bioavailability [255]. Currently, the pulmonary route has the most potential as an alternative route for the delivery of macromolecules to the lung, since the high molecular weight of these APIs reduces their diffusion from systemic circulation to the lung [243,250,252]. Inhaled mAbs are particularly important for addressing the transmission of viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) that shed into airway secretions [273]. Effective mAb concentrations in the lung can be achieved at low doses via inhalation compared to systemic administration, which could be critical for rapidly eradicating pandemics such as COVID-19 [274]. There is great interest in the pulmonary delivery of mAbs for the local treatment of chronic lung inflammatory diseases (e.g., asthma or COPD) and lung tumors [241,275]. Many inflammatory mediators and cells involved in the pathophysiology of these diseases (e.g., IL-13, IL-5, IgE, CD4) represent potential targets for mAb intervention [231,276]. For instance, anti-IgE mAbs (e.g., E25 or omalizumab) can mitigate early- and late-phase allergic responses to inhaled allergens in asthmatic patients [277]. Aerosolized cetuximab, a chimeric anti-epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mAb, also successfully reduced tumor growth in a lung tumor mouse model [275]. However, unfortunately, no inhaled mAb products have been approved. Almost all inhaled mAbs in pre-clinical development are administered via nebulizers [256,278\u2013280]. However, nebulized mAbs can undergo nebulization-induced or solution-induced instability as discussed in Section 5.2.1. The processing of liquid formulations into solid forms can protect protein molecules from stress caused by nebulization or water. Therapeutic proteins are then delivered in dry powder form, which frees the individual molecules from mechanical stress during aerosolization. Maa et al. at Genentech (South San Francisco, CA, US) compared the utility of spray-drying versus spray-freeze-drying techniques for producing inhaled mAb powders that exhibit good aerosol performance [212]. Spray-freeze-dried particles loaded with 60\u201390% anti-IgE mAb were porous and large (i.e., a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 8\u201310 \u00b5m) and thus showed a significantly enhanced fine particle fraction compared to the dense spray-dried particles (with a MMAD of ~ 3 \u00b5m) with the same mAb loading. The formulation of spray-dried protein powders containing carbohydrates (e.g., trehalose or lactose) can stabilize the therapeutic protein via a reduction in aggregation. However, these excipients can negatively affect the powder\u2019s aerosolization efficiency [262]. Therefore, stabilizing excipients should be included in the formulation at an optimal ratio that stabilizes the therapeutic protein but maintains the powder\u2019s aerosol performance. Sch\u00fcle et al. at Boehringer Ingelheim (Rhein, Germany) investigated the possible stabilization of IgG1 humanized mAb spray-dried powder for inhalation via the inclusion of mannitol [241]. Amorphous inhaled mAb powders prepared at IgG1-to-mannitol ratios of 60:40, 70:30, or 80:20 w/w were stable for more than one year at 2\u20138 \u00b0C and at 25 \u00b0C. With a 2.5% total solid content, these powders showed an MMAD of 3\u20134 \u00b5m, a fine particle fraction of 14%, and an emitted dose of 66.2\u201385.2%. Mannitol, combined with either trehalose or sucrose (with an IgG1\u2013mannitol\u2013trehalose/sucrose ratio of 80:13.3:6.6), further enhanced the powder\u2019s stability and flow properties [241]. Andya et al. at Genentech reported that the inclusion of mannitol in the spray-dried powder of anti-IgE humanized mAb at an excipient-to-protein molar ratio > 200:1 resulted in crystallization that can reduce the protein\u2019s stability and aerosol performance [262]. Spray-dried formulations containing 30% mannitol (i.e., mannitol-protein molar ratio of 350:1) showed a remarkable reduction in their fine particle fraction after storage at 5 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C. This was attributed to mannitol crystallization [263]. The fine particle fraction of powders containing 10% and 20% mannitol did not change significantly during storage. Agents that reduce mannitol crystallization (e.g., sodium phosphate) can expand mannitol\u2019s utility as an excipient for the production of stabilized spray-dried protein formulations suitable for inhalation [263]. Sucrose and trehalose were reported to be more efficient than mannitol in protecting model IgG antibodies against spray-drying-induced perturbation of its solid-state conformation [281,282]. Finally, trileucine was also reported to enhance the stability and aerosol performance of spray-dried protein powders. Its stabilizing properties result from its high glass transition temperature (i.e., ~ 104 \u00b0C), and it enhances aerosol performance through the formation of corrugated particles with low cohesiveness [283]. The efforts of formulation scientists have led to some progress in clinical settings. For example, a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose clinical study (i.e., NCT02473939) showed that inhaled CDP7766 (i.e., an anti-IL-13 mAb Fab fragment) powder (i.e., VR942, UCB4144; UCB, Brussels, Belgium) is well tolerated in both healthy and asthmatic subjects [276]. Prepared by spray-drying technology, VR942 powder for inhalation is composed of CDP7766 (4 or 40% w/w), buffer salts (0.5 or 5.1% w/w), leucine (10% w/w), and amorphous trehalose (85.5 or 44.9% w/w). Amorphous trehalose acts as a stabilizing agent due to its high glass transition temperature (~117 \u00b0C) and its ability to replace water during protein dehydration, thus maintaining the protein\u2019s conformation [284]. Inhaled CDP7766 powder did not achieve a significant systemic exposure. However, it showed a dose-dependent sustained inhibition of fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels (i.e., a biomarker of lung inflammation) [276]. CSJ117 (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) is a fully human neutralizing antibody fragment against human thymic stomal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released by airway epithelial cells in response to asthma triggers. It was developed as a potential add-on therapy for severe uncontrolled asthma [285]. It was formulated as PulmoSol\u2122, an engineered powder for pulmonary delivery via DPI [286]. The results of a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (i.e., NCT04410523) showed that inhaled CSJ117 is safe and well tolerated in adult patients with mild asthma [286]. The inhaled CSJ117 formulation is more convenient than the systemic delivery of tezepelumab (a potential first-in-class anti-TSLP human mAb) since it avoids the inhibition of TSLP signaling outside the respiratory tract [287]. 5.3.2 Inhaled enzymes Pulmozyme\u00ae (dornase alfa) (Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) is the first inhaled therapeutic protein product approved by the US FDA. It was approved in 1993 for lung delivery [249,250]. It is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I enzyme (rhDNase, molecular weight of ~ 37 kDa) used in combination with standard therapies for the management of cystic fibrosis. Pulmozyme\u00ae is provided as a solution for inhalation composed of rhDNase enzyme (1 mg/mL), calcium chloride dihydrate (0.15 mg/mL) and sodium chloride (8.77 mg/mL). It is recommended to be administered using either jet or mesh nebulizers [288,289]. Multiple studies have reported the feasibility of developing rhDNase dry powders for inhalation using various technologies (e.g., spray drying, spray-freeze drying) and various excipients (e.g., lactose, mannitol) [212,290,291]. The work at Genentech showed that spray-freeze drying can produce inhaled rhDNase powders with superior aerosol performance compared to the spray-drying technique [212]. In these studies rhDNase loading varied from 10.5% to 82.6% w/w. Excipients such as polyaspartate and gelsolin can enhance the rhDNase-induced fluidization of CF sputum and thus improve the efficacy of Pulmozyme\u00ae [292]. Sodium chloride enhanced the fine particle fraction (FPF) of spray-dried rhDNase powder in a dose-dependent manner [291]. \u03b1-1-antitrypsin is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 52 kDa that is synthesized predominantly in hepatocytes [292]. Currently, augmentation therapy is the only available approach for the management of \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and it is associated with many limitations [293,294]. The inconvenience of this conventional approach has promoted the investigation of augmentation via inhalation [292]. Inhaled \u03b1-1-antitrypsin can reach the deep lung, where it is absorbed into systemic circulation [295]. Aerosolized \u03b1-1-antitrypsin decreased neutrophil elastase activity and proinflammatory cytokine levels in CF patients. It also returned anti-neutrophil elastase activity to normal in patients with \u03b1-1-antitrypsin deficiency [293,296]. Importantly, a dry powder of purified plasma \u03b1-1-antitrypsin was developed using spray drying for inhalation using a pulmonary delivery system (Nektar, San Carlos, CA). The MMAD of this powder was 2 \u00b5m and \u03b1-1-antitrypsin loading was \u224873% [297]. Inhalation of \u03b1-1-antitrypsin powder reduced the activity of neutrophil serine proteinases in \u03b1-1-antitrypsin-deficient patients [298]. Thus, both patients and pharmaceutical companies support the development of a commercially available inhaled \u03b1-1-antitrypsin product [295]. 5.3.3 Inhaled insulin products On February 20, 2020, the US FDA issued a final rule to amend its definition of a biologic product. The rule further defines protein as \u201cany alpha amino acid polymer with a specific, defined sequence that is >40 amino acids in size\u201d [299]. This rule has been in effect since March 23, 2020. According to this definition, insulin (composed of 51 amino acids with a total molecular weight of 5.81 kDa) is considered a biologic product. Insulin is the only systemically acting therapeutic protein with commercial products available for administration via a noninvasive route (i.e., pulmonary route) [224]. Attempts to deliver insulin via the pulmonary route have occurred since 1925 [300]. Inhaled insulin has successfully improved glycemic control in difficult-to-treat patient groups (i.e., patients with needle phobia or severe injection site problems) [301]. The absorption of inhaled insulin follows first-order kinetics, and it fits the one-compartment model [264]. A meta-analysis of human clinical data for inhaled insulin showed that the absorption of insulin from the lung is dose independent (at inhaled doses of 0.3\u20131.8 international units [IUs]/kg) and mediated by passive diffusion [302]. Table 3 summarizes various aspects of the two approved inhaled insulin powder products (i.e., Exubera\u00ae and Afrezza\u00ae). Exubera (Pfizer, New York, NY, and Nektar Therapeutics, San Carlos, CA) is a rapid-acting regular insulin of recombinant DNA origin designed to deliver prandial insulin via the pulmonary route of administration [257,303]. It was the first-in-class inhaled insulin product, thus it was a massive technical achievement that required the development and integration of various new technologies, including (a) protein formulation and stabilization in dry powder form, (b) the development of dry powders for inhalation with efficient aerosolization, (c) powder filling, (d) moisture-protective packaging, and (e) the design of a dry powder inhaler device for powder dispersion and reliable dosing [304,305]. Exubera\u2019s powder filling and dose metering system and packaging equipment are integrated together to allow the on-line filling and sealing of the aluminum foil blisters [304]. In Exubera\u00ae, insulin was formulated as an amorphous powder in a buffered sugar-based matrix composed of a novel excipient combination [303,304]. The powder consisted of regular human insulin (60.0% w/w), sodium citrate dihydrate (27.1% w/w), mannitol (10.0% w/w), glycine (2.6% w/w), and sodium hydroxide (0.3% w/w) [307]. Insulin stability was reported to be improved in amorphous versus crystalline solids and aqueous solutions [307]. The dry powder for inhalation was produced by spray-drying the aqueous solution of insulin and excipients to ensure the production of homogenous particles with uniform morphology, suitable MMAD (i.e., 1\u20135 \u00b5m), and low moisture content [304]. The dry powder for inhalation was produced using the rapid spray-drying technique, thus maintaining the secondary structure and biological activity of the insulin [304]. Sodium citrate imparts a high glass transition temperature (i.e., 78\u201395 \u00b0C), which reduces molecular mobility so the powder can be stored at room temperature [307]. Interestingly, the insulin powder showed no sign of crystallization even after it was exposed to temperatures higher than its glass transition temperature. This could be attributed to the mutual dilution of individual components in the amorphous matrix [304,307]. The powder also exhibited minimal hygroscopicity (i.e., moisture content < 5%), and it was further protected from humidity by using moisture-protective packages [304]. Unfortunately, in October 2007, Pfizer (New York, NY) announced that it would withdraw Exubera\u00ae from the market after 11 years of development, and after only about one year on the market, due to very low sales (i.e., only USD 12 million for the first nine months of 2007 versus the estimated annual sales of USD 1\u20132 billion for Exubera\u00ae) [308,315]. Nine years later, Technosphere\u00ae insulin powder (TI) was approved by the FDA under the name Afrezza\u00ae (MannKind Corporation/Sanofi-Aventis). TI is a dry powder formulation of regular human insulin for pulmonary administration. It was developed to improve prandial glycemic control in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [306]. In 2015, Afrezza\u00ae was the only FDA-approved inhaled insulin available on the market [309]. It is a drug\u2013device combination product consisting of TI and a breath-powered oral inhaler device [309]. The Afrezza\u00ae Gen2 (i.e., DreamBoat) inhaler device is a thumb-sized, easy-to-use device that requires less inspiratory effort [309,310]. Technosphere\u00ae is a versatile, innovative drug carrier technology that enables the stabilization and pulmonary administration of therapeutic agents including proteins and peptides [313]. The platform of Technosphere\u00ae is based on particles formed when fumaryl diketopiperazine (FDKP) undergoes self-assembly in a slightly acidic solution (i.e., pH < 5) by hydrogen bonding into microparticles [260,316,317]. FDKP (i.e., bis-3,6(4-fumarylaminobutyl)-2,5-diketopiperazine) is an FDA-approved inert pharmaceutical excipient. It is used as a carrier for inhalation that promotes efficient aerosol performance and safety [316]. It undergoes rapid dissolution after it is inhaled into the neutral pH of the lung alveoli (i.e., pH 7), thus it can overcome the challenge of dissolving particles in the small amounts of fluid available in the lung lining [259]. FDKP is then rapidly absorbed through the alveolar walls into systemic circulation, followed by excretion from the kidneys [259,318,319]. The oral bioavailability of FDKP is negligible [319]. TI is composed of insulin and FDKP in a ratio of 1:9 w/w. The formulation process involves a controlled pH-dependent crystallization of FDKP into nanocrystals, which then undergo self-assembly into microparticles. When insulin is present in the FDKP solution during the precipitation process, it will be electrostatically adsorbed on the nanocrystal surface [259,260,264]. Thus, Technosphere\u00ae particles can carry insulin into the alveoli, where insulin and FDKP rapidly dissolve and are absorbed into systemic circulation independently with an absorption half-life of \u22481h [259,318,320]. The rapid pharmacokinetic profile of insulin delivered as TI could be attributed to its efficient powder delivery to the deep lung and rapid dissolution at physiological pH, which in turn establishes a steep concentration gradient [258,310,313,318,321]. TI is not exposed to significant mucociliary clearance or alveolar phagocytosis due to its rapid dissolution profile; therefore, lung metabolism is the main non-absorptive mechanism of insulin clearance from the lung [258]. So, one could conclude that FDKP acts only as a carrier that enables insulin to reach the lung alveoli, where the therapeutic protein is rapidly absorbed through natural mechanisms [321]. However, FDKP was also reported to maintain insulin species in the monomeric state, which enhances its uptake and bioavailability [245]. This signifies the crucial role of excipients in the formulation of stable and effective inhaled biologics. On the other hand, early after therapy initiation, TI decreases lung function; however, these changes were clinically irrelevant [322,323]. Moreover, TI therapy is associated with a cough that frequently made patients discontinue treatment [310]. Exubera\u00ae possesses similar adverse effects, in addition to a small increased risk of lung cancer [324\u2013326]. 5.4 Current development progress in academia Various technologies have been employed for the development of protein dry powders. Stresses encountered during the drying process can result in protein destabilization. In academia, a great effort has been employed in the development of effective strategies to protect protein therapeutics from drying-induced perturbation of their protein structures. The most commonly employed stabilizing strategies include the optimization of processing parameters and the incorporation of stabilizing pharmaceutical excipients. 5.4.1 Supercritical fluid technology A supercritical fluid is a gas or liquid maintained at a temperature and pressure above its critical values [327]. It has the density and solvation power of a liquid combined with a gas-like viscosity and diffusivity. The solvation powers and densities of supercritical fluids can be adjusted by varying their temperatures and pressures [328]. Carbon dioxide is the most widely used supercritical fluid for processing pharmaceuticals due to its low toxicity, low critical temperature (31.1 \u00b0C), moderate critical pressure (73.8 bar), and cost effectiveness [328]. Supercritical fluids have been commonly utilized in the production of protein powders [329\u2013333]. For instance, stable human serum IgG dry powder was produced using a supercritical carbon dioxide drying process. Jovanovi\u0107 et al. recommended the use of stabilizing excipients (e.g., trehalose), buffers, and the avoidance of ethanol use in order to stabilize the therapeutic protein [334]. Trehalose containing lysozyme powder was also produced using supercritical fluid technology. The secondary as well as the tertiary structures of the lysozyme were maintained after reconstitution [335]. Various techniques of particle engineering using supercritical fluids have been previously reviewed [327,329,330]. For instance, anti-CD4 antibodies, \u03b11-antitrypsin, and trypsinogen were successfully processed into dry powders with suitable aerodynamic properties for deep lung deposition (i.e., MMADs of 1.4 \u00b5m, 2.2 \u00b5m, and 0.8\u20131.4 \u00b5m, respectively) using carbon dioxide\u2013assisted nebulization with a Bubble Dryer\u00ae [330]. The activity of these biologics was completely preserved in dry powders formulated in the presence of excipients such as sucrose, trehalose, or other proprietary buffered solutions. 5.4.2 Electrospinning Electrospinning is a continuous drying technology in which a viscoelastic polymer solution is converted to solid nanofibers by the stretching of the fluid under the application of an electric field. The electrospun powder has an enhanced dissolution profile and could be administered via multiple routes of administration (e.g., oral, buccal) [336,337]. Electrospinning is advantageous in terms of offering gentle drying conditions at ambient temperatures, thus it is used in the preparation of dried protein formulations [338]. For example, electrospinning was successfully employed to prepare hydroxypropyl \u03b2-cyclodextrin\u2013based powder formulations for \u03b2-galactosidase [339]. The stability of the tableted formulation was maintained for up to 6 months of storage at room temperature. In addition, electrospinning was successfully used to prepare polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers loaded with bovine serum albumin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). These nanofibers resulted in the rapid release of the protein under physiological conditions, which could be tuned using various polymer coatings [340]. 5.4.3 Freeze drying Freeze drying is the main technique utilized for converting therapeutic proteins to dry powder forms to enhance their long-term storage stability [281]. This allows the production of dried protein formulations that are stable for months or even years at ambient temperatures [341\u2013343]. Although most proteins are robust to freeze\u2013thaw cycles when formulated with the right excipients, they can also undergo extensive aggregation upon lyophilization [229]. Freeze-drying was also reported to induce protein unfolding and the formation of visible and subvisible aggregates [252,344]. Solid-state hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange with mass spectrometric analysis (ssHDX-MS) can detect drying technique\u2013induced structural changes in therapeutic proteins that are difficult to detect using spectroscopic methods (e.g., solid-state fluorescence, FTIR) [281]. Excipients (e.g., sucrose, trehalose, mannitol) are commonly employed to stabilize freeze-dried proteins against conformational instability and aggregation that could result during freezing or the subsequent drying steps [6,252,345\u2013347]. Other than injections, freeze-dried powders were also considered for use in other dosage forms such as inhalation, after they are properly processed. However, Qian et al. reported that grinding the freeze-dried mAb powder results in the formation of subvisible protein particles that are potentially immunogenic [348]. Therefore, other techniques that produce powders with controlled particle sizes (e.g., spray drying) should be utilized, if possible, to avoid grinding stresses. 5.4.4 Spray drying Spray drying is a one-step technique that has been widely used to prepare inhaled powders for therapeutic proteins with a suitable shape, density, and particle size (i.e., 1\u20137 \u00b5m) for lung deposition [241]. The morphology of spray-dried protein powders depends on the operational parameters as well as formulation variables [281,349]. Generally, the sphericity of the resulting protein particles is enhanced at low outlet temperatures (i.e., slower drying speeds). Spherical particles have been shown to elicit lower toxicity effects in lung tissue compared to acicular particles because they avoid frustrated phagocytosis [268]. Excipients may also impact the sphericity of the resulting protein particles. For example, spray-dried bovine serum albumin and humanized E25 mAb particles showed smooth surfaces at different lactose-to-protein ratios; however, the inclusion of mannitol at > 30% of the total solids resulted in the formation of particles with rough surfaces due to recrystallization [349]. As discussed in Section 4.4.3, both processing and formulation factors should be considered when developing spray-dried products. A spray-dried infliximab dry powder for inhalation developed using trehalose, cysteine, and Tween 20 as excipients showed slow aggregation and fragmentation rate constants (i.e., 0.07 and 0.05 month\u22121, respectively) when stored at 40 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity for up to 2 months [350]. Cysteine induced the formation of raisin-like particles with a large surface area and high lung deposition (i.e., an FPF of 67.75 \u00b1 1.29%). Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC, a main component of the lung surfactant) enhanced the absorption of growth hormone into the bloodstream after the intratracheal insufflation of the spray-dried powder [351]. DPPC occupies the air\u2013liquid interface during the atomization step and thus minimizes protein aggregation and unfolding. Alternatively, nano\u2013spray drying has emerged as a simple approach to produce protein nanoparticles. It can address various limitations of traditional spray dryers (e.g., the collection of protein nanoparticles) [352]. This technique relies on vibrating mesh technology to generate fine droplets and laminar air flow that achieves gentle heating to preserve the stability of thermosensitive biologics [352]. 5.4.5 Spray-freeze-drying Spray-freeze-drying combines the advantages of both freeze drying and spray drying to produce highly porous particles suitable for inhalation [353\u2013355]. It allows the formulation of biologics into a solid form with good flow properties and controlled particle size distributions, which can be used as inhalation powders [356]. Spray-freeze-dried mAb powders are advantageous in terms of their characteristically high specific surface area, which allows rapid reconstitution [357]. However, spray-freeze-drying exposes the protein molecules to more stresses than conventional freeze-drying due to the atomization step and the fast-freezing rates that are required [353]. Air\u2013liquid interfaces, phase separation, and ice crystallization are additional stresses encountered by therapeutic proteins during the spray-freeze-drying process [358]. To counteract these stresses, one must identify the appropriate excipients that best protect the given API. These excipients can include polymers (e.g., hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin [353,358]), sugars (e.g., sucrose, trehalose, mannitol [353,357]), and amino acids (e.g., leucine, phenylalanine, glycine [357,359]). 5.4.6 Nanocarriers for protein delivery Nanocarriers are advantageous in terms of protecting therapeutic proteins and other macromolecular drugs against degradation, controlling their release, and enhancing their safety and efficacy via targeted delivery [250,360]. Nanoparticles can readily translocate through biological membranes due to their high surface area\u2013to-volume ratio and high mobility, and they are internalized by various endocytic pathways [200]. The polyelectrolytes that comprise the nanoparticle scaffold (e.g., chitosan, alginate, chondroitin sulfate, poly [\u03b3-glutamic acid]) can protect protein therapeutics against degradation and enhance their absorption, especially after oral or intranasal administration [228]. Nanocarriers can also modify the pharmacokinetic profiles of various APIs, including therapeutic proteins [361,362]. For instance, orally administered poly(n-butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles achieved glucose-lowering activity by controlling the rate of insulin release [363]. Nanoparticles are also readily amenable to the various drying processes discussed above. Spray drying has been widely investigated to convert protein-loaded nanoparticles into dry powders for inhalation. For instance, an inhaled dry powder (i.e., MMAD of 2\u20133 \u00b5m) of insulin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles was prepared using co\u2013spray drying with mannitol to achieve high deposition in the deep lung where insulin can be absorbed to systemic circulation [364,365]. Al-Qadi et al. also reported that inhaled, spray-dried, insulin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles produced a pronounced hypoglycemic effect after intratracheal administration in rats [366]. The formulation of nanoparticle-based dry powders for inhalation could be a promising approach to simultaneously enhance both protein stability and targeting. The combination of drying and nanoparticle technologies can lead to stable, noninvasive, targeted, or controlled-released protein products such as implants, DPIs, buccal films, and microneedles. 5.4.7 Thin-film freeze drying Thin-film freeze drying (TFFD) is an ultra-rapid freezing technology [258]. TFFD involves the rapid freezing of the API solution (with or without excipients) in < 1 s by spreading it onto a cryogenically cooled surface [367]. Then, the resulting frozen films are collected and lyophilized [64]. This process was designed to improve the dissolution and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble APIs via the formulation of amorphous solid dispersions [368]. Additionally, TFFD was reported to be more efficient in protecting protein molecules against denaturation compared to other cryogenic techniques [258]. The advantages of TFFD technology in the formulation of therapeutic protein powders include (a) the production of a low-density matrix suitable for inhalation and (b) a small air\u2013water interface that maintains protein stability and bioactivity [369]. It was also reported to cause less denaturation of protein molecules than other cryogenic techniques [258]. For example, a highly stable lactate dehydrogenase powder that maintained enzymatic activity was successfully prepared using TFFD [211]. The immunogenicity of a thin-film, freeze-dried, Alhydrogel\u00ae-adjuvanted ovalbumin model vaccine was preserved after the model vaccine dry powder was stored at temperatures as high as 40 \u00b0C for up to three months [33]. TFFD has also been shown to result in inhalable protein powders [370]. The brittle matrix was considered to be composed of nanoaggregates, which usually allows faster dissolution. Thus, TFFD is suitable for delivery as a dry power inhalation, and it also has the potential to be developed into buccal films or amorphous powders for use in oral tablets or capsules. 6 Comments and perspectives Biological solids offer clear advantages over traditional liquid formulations, such as (a) improved thermal stability and shelf-life and (b) expanded possibilities for delivery through noninvasive routes. For example, TFFD has been shown to stabilize proteins and living organisms [34,65]. Spray drying was shown to stabilize phages for over 12 months under ambient conditions [128]. Lyophilization has been used extensively to stabilize proteins and vaccines. It was even shown to preserve the viability of mesenchymal stem cells for up to 3 weeks at 2\u20138 \u00b0C [116]. Improved stability and longer shelf-life provide added patient benefits. Solid dosage forms may allow the storage of traditionally frozen drug products at 2\u20138 \u00b0C or the storage of traditionally refrigerated drug products at room temperature. Reduced cold chain constraints expands access to broader patient populations and geographic areas that lack the healthcare infrastructure needed to store and administer frozen drug products. Further, improved thermal stability may also help alleviate patient compliance concerns. Biologic solids with demonstrated room temperature stability may be taken home and self-administered by patients, while avoiding problems resulting from improper handling or storage in the home. Biologic solids are also inherently amenable to noninvasive routes of administration such as dry powders for inhalation, thin films for buccal or sublingual administration, and tablets for sublingual or oral delivery. For example, jet milling, spray drying, spray-freeze drying, and TFFD have all been shown to produce powders suitable for inhalation [132,217,241,353\u2013355,369]. Two inhalable dry powder products (Afrezza\u00ae and Exubera\u00ae) have received marketing approval for the administration of insulin. Thin films administered through the sublingual or buccal route have been shown to deliver vaccines that elicit immune responses comparable to intramuscular injection [34]. Tablets administered via the sublingual route have also been shown to deliver vaccines [68]. Noninvasive administration also provides key benefits to patients. Inhalation, buccal, sublingual, and oral administration all are pain-free alternatives to traditional subcutaneous or intravenous administration. Further, these products may be taken home and self-administered by patients, eliminating the need for trained healthcare providers, reducing costs, and expanding access. Alternate routes of administration may also help mitigate unintended immunogenicity. In a long-term follow-up study of 272 patients taking adalimumab, 28% of the patients developed anti-drug antibodies after three years of treatment [371]. The formation of anti-drug antibodies can diminish the efficacy of the drug and can even lead to treatment failure. However, alternate routes of administration offer potential solutions to this problem. For example, pulmonary drug delivery generally stimulates mucosal immune responses, while parenteral drug delivery stimulates systemic immune responses. Subtleties even exist within pulmonary drug delivery: The lung delivery of a hepatitis B vaccine induced strong immune responses, while intranasal delivery induced no immune response [372]. Further, intranasal delivery has been shown to activate Th17 cells, which are known to be involved in the development of immune tolerance [373\u2013375]. To realize these benefits, both industry and academia have made great strides in process and formulation development. The approvals of Exubera\u00ae, Afrezza\u00ae, Rybelsus\u00ae, MYCAPSSA\u00ae, Pulmozyme\u00ae, and many other products prove that biologics can be delivered through noninvasive routes. Fig. 2 highlights selected development milestones of each type of biological modality. Pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in the development of novel drying technologies. These include radiant energy vacuum technology, LyoSphere\u2122, Technosphere\u00a9, aseptic spray drying (e.g., Raplixa\u00ae), and aseptic spray-freeze drying. Pharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in the development of novel delivery technologies, excipients, and delivery vectors, including microneedle arrays (e.g., NanoPatches\u2122), penetration enhancers (e.g., Rybelsus, MYCAPSSA), nonviral vectors (e.g., Onpattro\u00ae), and viral vectors (e.g., IMLYGIC\u00ae). In academia, novel processing techniques are being developed or refined, including spray drying, spray-freeze drying, supercritical fluid technologies, and 3-D printing. For example, the TFFD process has been extensively studied for small-molecule delivery, but it has also successfully processed proteins (e.g., lysozymes, lactate dehydrogenase, neutralizing mAbs) and bacteriophages [376,377], making this a potentially powerful formulation processing tool to develop biologics for dry powder inhalation. Nonetheless, the specific liabilities of the biologic being processed must be considered when selecting a processing technique. Biologics that are sensitive to freezing stresses may be better suited for milling, spray-drying, or supercritical fluid processing, while biologics sensitive to shear stress may be better suited for freeze drying or TFFD. Researchers are also exploring novel formulation technologies to expand the processing and administration design space. For example, nanoparticles have been shown to protect biologics from shear-induced degradation during spray drying [95]. Incorporating polymers has been shown to reduce the thermal stress required for hot-melt extrusion [201]. And, excipient-free formulations have been developed to reduce powder irritation and increase the quantity of deliverable drug through inhalation [132]. Still, further advancements will be required over the next few years. The challenges encountered in the development of solid dosage forms vary depending on the modality (e.g., peptide, protein, genetic materials, mammalian cell, viral of both bacterial and mammalian), the therapeutics\u2019 in vivo and in vitro stability profiles, the site of action (i.e., local or systemic), and the administration route. For example, 1) tremendous efforts have been made to develop peptides for oral delivery; however, the biggest barrier has always been GI tract digestion; 2) inhalation is considered the best alternative route to injections for delivering modalities such as proteins, gene therapeutics, and bacteriophages [378]; however, there are still outstanding issues such as stability during the dehydration processes, dose limitation, and unclear clearance and absorption mechanisms in the lung for large molecules; 3) Identifying suitable excipients and validated drying techniques are critical steps for developing solid cell therapy products, and the exploration has just started. 4) When developing microneedle vaccines, retaining the antigens\u2019 potency during coating onto solid microneedles or during encapsulation within a dissolving microneedle system is a significant barrier during vaccine patch development [379]. Thus, there is no single approach to follow when developing solid dosage forms for therapeutic proteins or other biologics; rather, development must proceed on a case-by-case basis [361]. The design of experiments that evaluate single- and multi-factor process parameters and formulations can help streamline the development process. Indeed, much work has been done to identify excipients that can stabilize biologics after drying and produce suitable solid dosage forms for noninvasive administration (e.g., aerosol performance for dry powder inhalation, dissolution rate for thin-film buccal delivery). For example, mannitol, sucrose, trehalose, lactose, and trileucine have all been shown to stabilize proteins and produce suitable dry powders for inhalation [241,263,281,283]. The ratios between the various excipients and the proteins were critical to prevent crystallization and maintain fine particle fraction throughout storage. However, studies to date typically focus on a single model biologic and a limited set of quality attributes (e.g., potency, fine particle fraction, dissolution rate). It is critical to expand our understanding of the various processing methods, their impact on critical quality attributes, and formulations that can mitigate this impact across biologic modalities. Modeling may help accelerate this effort. The modeling of drying methods would provide a better understanding of the expected stresses as well as the impact of process parameters on the magnitude of those stresses. The modeling of protein unfolding and protein\u2013protein interactions could help identify stabilizing excipients that prevent aggregation and degradation during drying and on stability. In addition, the exploration of novel excipients such as polymers, peptide or protein excipients, modified amino acids, or permeation enhancers is warranted to prevent degradation, extend half-life, and improve bioavailability. Finally, formulation development must focus on the route of administration and its benefits to patients. For example, successful inhaled products should exert rapid dissolution in the alveolar aqueous mucus layer to achieve rapid absorption into systemic circulation before clearance from the lung. Rapid dissolution results in minimal accumulation of the biologic and excipients in the lung and thus results in fewer patient side effects. Certainly, formulation advances have resulted in the successful marketing of several solid dosage forms for the delivery of biologics, including forms administered via the pulmonary route. Nevertheless, some of these products were withdrawn from the market after a short period of sales due to a lack of focus on the patient. The withdrawal of Exubera\u00ae raised significant concerns about the future applicability of the pulmonary route for insulin administration [313]. However, the reasons that could have caused the failure of Exubera\u00ae and the success of Afrezza\u00ae could also help inspire innovative technologies to develop successful products for other biologics. For example, products with an established parenteral competitor should allow patients and healthcare providers to easily calculate the equivalent of their previous injected doses. This lack of foresight was ultimately one of the key contributors to the failure of Exubera\u00ae (i.e., the dose strengths of Exubera\u00ae are available only in milligrams of insulin as opposed to the traditional IU of insulin). 7 Conclusion Much progress has been made to advance biologic solids into the clinic and to the market. In academia, novel technologies and accumulated experience has rapidly advanced both process development and formulation development. Yet, further innovations are needed to advance solid dosage forms and expand access to noninvasive administration routes. Different administration routes require different performance characteristics to overcome the relevant biological barriers. Thus, the route of administration affects both the processing methods and the excipients selected to enhance bioavailability. In addition, knowledge of the interplay between process parameters and the formulation is also indispensable. Nonetheless, it is the authors\u2019 belief that continued focus on these issues and continued investment in these areas of research will enable expanded applications of biologic solids to address unmet medical needs.

At the same time, the discovery and application of new modalities, such as cellular therapies and gene therapies, have presented formidable challenges to formulation scientists. We explore these challenges and highlight the opportunities to overcome them through the development of novel formulations and drug delivery systems as biological solids. We review the current progress in both industry and academic laboratories, and we provide expert perspectives in those settings.
