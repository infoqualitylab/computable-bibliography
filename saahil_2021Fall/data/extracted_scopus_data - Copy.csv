Human Influenza Resulting from Aerosol Inhalation,"Volunteers were given A2 influenza virus in a small-particle aerosol. Infection and typical influenza resulted from low doses of virus administered in this manner. Low levels of serum neutralizing antibody were not completely effective in preventing infection and illness. The human infectious dose of this influenza strain when administered by aerosol to subjects free of serum neutralizing antibody was approximately 3 TCID50. Gratitude is expressed to Dr. David W. Ailing for assistance with the statistics and in calculating dosages; Mr. Edward W. Harvey, Mr. Irven B. Stacy, Mr. Leonard P. Durocher, and Mr. James Turner for technical assistance; and Mr. Edward P. Derren-bacher aand Mr. Charles O. Masemore for assistance with volunteer inoculations. © 1966, SAGE Publications.

Influenza A virus is transmissible via aerosolized fomites,"© 2020, The Author(s).Influenza viruses are presumed, but not conclusively known, to spread among humans by several possible routes. We provide evidence of a mode of transmission seldom considered for influenza: airborne virus transport on microscopic particles called “aerosolized fomites.” In the guinea pig model of influenza virus transmission, we show that the airborne particulates produced by infected animals are mainly non-respiratory in origin. Surprisingly, we find that an uninfected, virus-immune guinea pig whose body is contaminated with influenza virus can transmit the virus through the air to a susceptible partner in a separate cage. We further demonstrate that aerosolized fomites can be generated from inanimate objects, such as by manually rubbing a paper tissue contaminated with influenza virus. Our data suggest that aerosolized fomites may contribute to influenza virus transmission in animal models of human influenza, if not among humans themselves, with important but understudied

Effects of a “New” Human Respiratory Virus in Volunteers,"A virus, 229-E, which morphologically resembles avian infectious bronchitis virus has been passed serially four times in man. Colds were produced in 13 out of 26 inoculated volunteers. There was a significant association between the presence of virus in the nose and the development of colds. Seven of the 13 volunteers who developed colds showed rising titres of antibody against this virus. The colds showed significantly longer incubation periods than did colds due to rhinoviruses, but no longer than those of colds caused by the related virus B814. The colds were also shorter and were associated with more nasal discharge than rhinovirus colds, but many of the differences are not statistically significant. Of 215 sera collected from children and adults in Britain in the past 10 years 29% contained neutralizing antibody. It is concluded that the virus can cause colds and probably circulates to a significant extent in this country. © 1967, British Medical Journal Publishing Group. All rights reserved.",1,
The time course of the immune response to experimental coronavirus infection of man,"After preliminary trials, the detailed changes in the concentration of specific circulating and local antibodies were followed in 15 volunteers inoculated with coronavirus 229E. Ten of them, who had significantly lower concentrations of pre-existing antibody than the rest, became infected and eight of these developed colds. A limited investigation of circulating lymphocyte populations showed some lymphocytopenia in infected volunteers. In this group, antibody concentrations started to increase 1 week after inoculation and reached a maximum about 1 week later. Thereafter antibody titres slowly declined. Although concentrations were still slightly raised 1 year later, this did not always prevent reinfection when volunteers were then challenged with the homologous virus. However, the period of virus shedding was shorter than before and none developed a cold. All of the uninfected group were infected on re-challenge although they also appeared to show some resistance to disease and in the extent of infection. These results are discussed with reference to natural infections with coronavirus and with other infections, such as rhinovirus infections. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Short-range airborne route dominates exposure of respiratory infection during close contact,"© 2020 Elsevier LtdA susceptible person experiences the highest exposure risk of respiratory infection when he or she is in close proximity with an infected person. The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (<2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 μm and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 μm and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing.",1,Airborne spread of

Detection of air and surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in hospital rooms of infected patients,"© 2020, The Author(s).Understanding the particle size distribution in the air and patterns of environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for infection prevention policies. Here we screen surface and air samples from hospital rooms of COVID-19 patients for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Environmental sampling is conducted in three airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the general ward. 245 surface samples are collected. 56.7% of rooms have at least one environmental surface contaminated. High touch surface contamination is shown in ten (66.7%) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness, and three (20%) beyond the first week of illness (p = 0.01, χ2 test). Air sampling is performed in three of the 27 AIIRs in the general ward, and detects SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive particles of sizes >4 µm and 1–4 µm in two rooms, despite these rooms having 12 air changes per hour. This warrants further study of the airborne transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2.",1,"Air, Surface Environmental, and Personal Protective Equipment Contamination by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) From a Symptomatic Patient",Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore,A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster,Asymptomatic cases in a family cluster with SARS-CoV-2 infection,Presumed Asymptomatic Carrier Transmission of COVID-19,Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals,Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1,SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in Upper Respiratory Specimens of Infected Patients,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens,Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019,Development of an improved methodology to detect infectious airborne influenza virus using the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler,COVID-19 and the risk to health care workers: A case report,Airborne influenza A virus exposure in an elementary school,Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR,Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome,Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore
MERS-CoV spike nanoparticles protect mice from MERS-CoV infection,"© 2017 Elsevier LtdThe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first discovered in late 2012 and has gone on to cause over 1800 infections and 650 deaths. There are currently no approved therapeutics or vaccinations for MERS-CoV. The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells, is immunodominant and induces neutralizing antibodies in vivo, all of which, make the S protein an ideal target for anti-MERS-CoV vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate protection induced by vaccination with a recombinant MERS-CoV S nanoparticle vaccine and Matrix-M1 adjuvant combination in mice.

Impact assessment of non-pharmaceutical interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza in Hong Kong: an observational study,"© 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licenseBackground: A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong. We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20–23, Feb 11–14, and March 10–13, 2020. Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34–53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26–1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70–0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24–43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06–1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68–0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. Interpretation: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

Pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory coronavirus deletion mutants in hACE-2 transgenic mice,"Recombinant severe acute respiratory virus (SARS-CoV) variants lacking the group specific genes 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b (rSARS-CoV-Δ[6-9b]), the structural gene E (rSARS-CoV-ΔE), and a combination of both sets of genes (rSARS-CoV-Δ[E,6-9b]) have been generated. All these viruses were rescued in monkey (Vero E6) cells and were also infectious for human (Huh-7, Huh7.5.1 and CaCo-2) cell lines and for transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), indicating that none of these proteins is essential for the viral cycle. Furthermore, in Vero E6 cells, all the viruses showed the formation of particles with the same morphology as the wt virus, indicating that these proteins do not have a high impact in the final morphology of the virions. Nevertheless, in the absence of E protein, release of virus particles efficacy was reduced. Viruses lacking E protein grew about 100-fold lower than the wt virus in lungs of Tg infected mice but did not grow in the brains of the same animals, in contrast to the rSARS-CoV-Δ[6-9b] virus, which grew almost as well as the wt in both tissues. Viruses lacking E protein were highly attenuated in the highly sensitive hACE-2 Tg mice, in contrast to the minimal rSARS-CoV-Δ[6-9b] and wt viruses. These data indicate that E gene might be a virulence factor influencing replication level, tissue tropism and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, suggesting that ΔE attenuated viruses are promising vaccine candidates. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular pathology of emerging coronavirus infections,"Copyright © 2014 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Respiratory viruses can cause a wide spectrum of pulmonary diseases, ranging from mild, upper respiratory tract infections to severe and life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections, including the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Viral clearance and subsequent recovery from infection require activation of an effective host immune response; however, many immune effector cells may also cause injury to host tissues. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, with 10%and 35% overall mortality rates, respectively; however, >50% mortality rates are seen in the aged and immunosuppressed populations. While these viruses are susceptible to interferon treatment in vitro, they both encode numerous genes that allow for successful evasion of the host immune system until after high virus titres have been achieved.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats imposes a narrow bottleneck,"Copyright: © 2021 Braun et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The evolutionary mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapt to mammalian hosts and, potentially, undergo antigenic evolution depend on the ways genetic variation is generated and selected within and between individual hosts. Using domestic cats as a model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences remain largely unchanged over time within hosts, while dynamic sub-consensus diversity reveals processes of genetic drift and weak purifying selection. We further identify a notable variant at amino acid position 655 in Spike (H655Y), which was previously shown to confer escape from human monoclonal antibodies. This variant arises rapidly and persists at intermediate frequencies in index cats. It also becomes fixed following transmission in two of three pairs. These dynamics suggest this site may be under positive selection in this system and illustrate how a variant can quickly arise and become fixed in parallel across multiple transmission pairs. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in cats involved a narrow bottleneck, with new infections founded by fewer than ten viruses. In RNA virus evolution, stochastic processes like narrow transmission bottlenecks and genetic drift typically act to constrain the overall pace of adaptive evolution. Our data suggest that here, positive selection in index cats followed by a narrow transmission bottleneck may have instead accelerated the fixation of S H655Y, a potentially beneficial SARS-CoV-2 variant. Overall, our study suggests species- and context-specific adaptations are likely to continue to emerge. This underscores the importance of continued genomic surveillance for new SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as heightened scrutiny for signatures of SARS-CoV-2 positive selection in humans and mammalian model systems.",2,"Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals to SARS-coronavirus 2","Comparative pathogenesis of COVID-19, MERS, and SARS in a nonhuman primate model",Syrian hamsters as a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and countermeasure development,Infection with novel coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) causes pneumonia in Rhesus macaques,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks, the Netherlands, April and May 2020",The search for a COVID-19 animal model,SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via contact and via the air between ferrets,Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms between humans and mink and back to humans,"Epidemiology, virology, and clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2; Coronavirus Disease-19)","Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study",Genetic bottlenecks in intraspecies virus transmission,Stochastic processes constrain the within and between host evolution of influenza virus,Influenza B Viruses Exhibit Lower Within-Host Diversity than Influenza A Viruses in Human Hosts,Selection on haemagglutinin imposes a bottleneck during mammalian transmission of reassortant H5N1 influenza viruses,Selective Bottlenecks Shape Evolutionary Pathways Taken during Mammalian Adaptation of a 1918-like Avian Influenza Virus,Influenza A virus transmission bottlenecks are defined by infection route and recipient host,Mammalian adaptation of influenza A(H7N9) virus is limited by a narrow genetic bottleneck,Reconciling disparate estimates of viral genetic diversity during human influenza infections,Transmission bottlenecks as determinants of virulence in rapidly evolving pathogens,Transmission bottlenecks and the evolution of fitness in rapidly evolving RNA viruses,"Transmission Bottleneck Size Estimation from Pathogen Deep-Sequencing Data, with an Application to Human Influenza A Virus",Deep Sequencing Reveals Potential Antigenic Variants at Low Frequencies in Influenza A Virus-Infected Humans,Emergence of Oseltamivir-Resistant H7N9 Influenza Viruses in Immunosuppressed Cynomolgus Macaques,Matters of Size: Genetic Bottlenecks in Virus Infection and Their Potential Impact on Evolution,Population Bottlenecks and Intra-host Evolution during Human-to-Human Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,Shared SARS-CoV-2 diversity suggests localised transmission of minority variants,Genomic epidemiology of superspreading events in Austria reveals mutational dynamics and transmission properties of SARSCoV-2,Wang Qet al.

Viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients,"© 2020 The Author(s)Objectives: Because the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols but failure to isolate viable (infectious) virus are commonly reported, there is substantial controversy whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through aerosols. This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle. Methods: Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced. Results: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.",1,The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Short-range airborne transmission of expiratory droplets between two people,"© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThe occurrence of close proximity infection for many respiratory diseases is often cited as evidence of large droplet and/or close contact transmission. We explored interpersonal exposure of exhaled droplets and droplet nuclei of two standing thermal manikins as affected by distance, humidity, ventilation, and breathing mode. Under the specific set of conditions studied, we found a substantial increase in airborne exposure to droplet nuclei exhaled by the source manikin when a susceptible manikin is within about 1.5 m of the source manikin, referred to as the proximity effect. The threshold distance of about 1.5 m distinguishes the two basic transmission processes of droplets and droplet nuclei, that is, short-range modes and the long-range airborne route. The short-range modes include both the conventional large droplet route and the newly defined short-range airborne transmission. We thus reveal that transmission occurring in close proximity to the source patient includes both droplet-borne (large droplet) and short-range airborne routes, in addition to the direct deposition of large droplets on other body surfaces. The mechanisms of the droplet-borne and short-range airborne routes are different; their effective control methods also differ.

Community use of face masks and COVID-19: Evidence from a natural experiment of state mandates in the US,"© 2020 Project HOPE— The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.State policies mandating public or community use of face masks or covers in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are hotly contested. This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020. The research design is an event study examining changes in the daily county-level COVID-19 growth rates between March 31 and May 22, 2020. Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.",1,Rational use of face masks in the COVID-19 pandemic,Evidence supporting transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 while presymptomatic or asymptomatic,Estimating the asymp-tomatic proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship,Cumulative in-cidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New York,Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19: Interim guidance [Inter-net],Face masks for the public during the covid-19 crisis,Facemasks and similar barriers to prevent respiratory ill-ness such as COVID-19: A rapid systematic review,Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses,Non-pharmaceutical measures for pandemic influenza in nonhealthcare settings—personal protective and environmental measures,Face mask use and control of respiratory virus transmission in households,Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Recommendation re-garding the use of cloth face cover-ings, especially in areas of signifi-cant community-based transmission [Internet]","Germans face fines of up to $5,000 as wearing a face mask becomes mandatory","France has made wearing face masks compulsory in public, while maintaining a controversial ban on burqas and niqabs",Coronavirus: Spain makes face masks compulsory on public transport as country begins to ease strict lockdown,"Tensions over masks, social distancing lead to violent altercations, shooting death, pipe bomb threats",An ongoing re-pository of data on coronavirus cases and deaths in the U.S,Strong social distancing measures in the United States reduced the COVID-19 growth rate,"Face masks to become part of life in California, but the rules vary",Face covering guidelines for businesses operating in Texas [Internet],These Colorado cities and counties require masks be worn in public places,"COVID-19 antibody seropreva-lence in Santa Clara County, Cali-fornia",The incubation period of corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: Estimation and application,Walmart is now requiring all US employees to wear face masks and will encourage customers to wear them while shopping,"Costco, Delta, United: List of businesses requiring employees or customers to wear face masks","Order of the governor of the state of Maryland, number 20-04-15-01 [Internet]",CDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastating

Evaluation of antihemagglutinin and antineuraminidase antibodies as correlates of protection in an influenza A/H1N1 virus healthy human challenge model,"© 2016 Memoli et al.Despite long-term investment, influenza continues to be a significant worldwide problem. The cornerstone of protection remains vaccination, and approved vaccines seek to elicit a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of>1:40 as the primary correlate of protection. However, recent poor vaccine performance raises questions regarding the protection afforded and whether other correlates of protection should be targeted. A healthy volunteer challenge study was performed with a wild-type 2009 A(H1N1)pdm influenza A challenge virus at the NIH Clinical Center to evaluate two groups of participants with HAI titers of>1:40 and<1:40. The primary objective was to determine whether participants with HAI titers of>1:40 were less likely to develop mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) after intranasal inoculation. HAI titers of>1:40 were protective against MMID but did not reduce the incidence of symptoms alone. Although the baseline HAI titer correlated with some reduction in disease severity measures, overall, the baseline NAI titer correlated more significantly with all disease severity metrics and had a stronger independent effect on outcome. This study demonstrates the importance of examining other immunological correlates of protection rather than solely HAI titers. This challenge study confirms the importance of NAI titer as a correlate and for the first time establishes that it can be an independent predictor of reduction of all aspects of influenza disease. This suggests that NAI titer may play a more significant role than previously thought and that neuraminidase immunity should be considered when studying susceptibility after vaccination and as a critical target in future influenza vaccine platforms. IMPORTANCE This study represents the first time the current gold standard for evaluating influenza vaccines as set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a “protective” hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of≥1:40, has been evaluated in a well-controlled healthy volunteer challenge study since the cutoff was established. We used our established wild-type influenza A healthy volunteer human challenge model to evaluate how well this antibody titer predicts a reduction in influenza virus-induced disease. We demonstrate that although higher HAI titer is predictive of some protection, there is stronger evidence to suggest that neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titer is more predictive of protection and reduced disease. This is the first time NAI titer has been clearly identified in a controlled trial of this type to be an independent predictor of a reduction in all aspects of influenza.",1,"Estimates of deaths associated with seasonal influenza—United States, 1976–2007",Public health.

A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence,"© 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation of respiratory aerosol in the Skagit Valley Chorale superspreading event,"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdDuring the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an outbreak occurred following attendance of a symptomatic index case at a weekly rehearsal on 10 March of the Skagit Valley Chorale (SVC). After that rehearsal, 53 members of the SVC among 61 in attendance were confirmed or strongly suspected to have contracted COVID-19 and two died. Transmission by the aerosol route is likely; it appears unlikely that either fomite or ballistic droplet transmission could explain a substantial fraction of the cases. It is vital to identify features of cases such as this to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was dominated by inhalation of respiratory aerosol generated by one index case, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of aerosol infectious quanta. We explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: ventilation rate, duration of event, and deposition onto surfaces. The results indicate a best-estimate emission rate of 970 ± 390 quanta/h. Infection risk would be reduced by a factor of two by increasing the aerosol loss rate to 5 h−1 and shortening the event duration from 2.5 to 1 h.",1,Comparative dynamic aerosol efficiencies of three emergent coronaviruses and the unusual persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol suspensions,Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1,Detection of air and surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in hospital rooms of infected patients,Toilets dominate environmental detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hospital,"Aerosol and surface distribution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 in hospital wards, Wuhan, China, 2020",Clinical data on hospital environmental hygiene monitoring and medical staffs protection during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak,Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals,Viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air of a hospital room with COVID-19 patients,Transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in viral shedding observed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center,Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples,Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study,Virological assessment of hospitalized patients with COVID-2019,Identifying and interrupting superspreading events—implications for control of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,Aerosol emission and superemission during human speech increase with voice loudness,Aerosol transmission of infectious disease,Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2,Closed environments facilitate secondary transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Clusters of coronavirus disease in communities, Japan, January–April 2020",An outbreak of influenza aboard a commercial airliner,Risk of indoor airborne infection transmission estimated from carbon dioxide concentration,Development of a dose-response model for SARS coronavirus,A choir decided to go ahead with rehearsal.

"Influenza Virus Aerosols in Human Exhaled Breath: Particle Size, Culturability, and Effect of Surgical Masks","The CDC recommends that healthcare settings provide influenza patients with facemasks as a means of reducing transmission to staff and other patients, and a recent report suggested that surgical masks can capture influenza virus in large droplet spray. However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza. We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (""coarse"">5 μm, ""fine""≤5 μm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus. Fine particles contained 8.8 (95% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak (r = 0.17, coarse; r = 0.29, fine fraction). Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples. Surgical masks worn by patients reduce aerosols shedding of virus. The abundance of viral copies in fine particle aerosols and evidence for their infectiousness suggests an important role in seasonal influenza transmission. Monitoring exhaled virus aerosols will be important for validation of experimental transmission studies in humans. © 2013 Milton et al.",1,Influenza virus in human exhaled breath: an observational study,The Mechanism of Breath Aerosol Formation,Quantifying the routes of transmission for pandemic influenza,Relative contributions of four exposure pathways to influenza infection risk,"Droplet fate in indoor environments, or can we prevent the spread of infection?",Transmission of influenza A in human beings,Review of aerosol transmission of influenza A virus,Use of a human influenza challenge model to assess person-to-person transmission: proof-of-concept study,Human influenza resulting from aerosol inhalation,A quantitative assessment of the efficacy of surgical and N95 masks to filter influenza virus in patients with acute influenza infection,Surgical mask filter and fit performance,Transmission parameters of the A/H1N1 (2009) influenza virus pandemic: a review,The effect of mask use on the spread of influenza during a pandemic,Facemasks and Hand Hygiene to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Households: A Randomized Trial,Respirator tolerance in health care workers,Measurements of airborne influenza virus in aerosol particles from human coughs,Aerosol transmission of influenza A virus: a review of new studies,Changing concepts of airborne infection of acute contagious diseases: a reconsideration of classic epidemiologic theories,Airborne influenza virus detection with four aerosol samplers using molecular and infectivity assays: considerations for a new infectious virus aerosol sampler,Development and performance evaluation of an exhaled-breath bioaerosol collector for influenza virus,Potential role of human challenge studies for investigation of influenza transmission,Time lines of infection and disease in human influenza: a review of volunteer challenge studies,Early Estimation of the Reproduction Number in the Presence of Imported Cases: Pandemic Influenza H1N1-2009 in New Zealand,Superspreading and the effect of individual variation on disease emergence,An optimized method to detect influenza virus and human rhinovirus from exhaled breath and the airborne environment,Simultaneous detection of influenza viruses A and B using real-time quantitative PCR
Toward understanding the risk of secondary airborne infection: Emission of respirable pathogens,"Certain respiratory tract infections are transmitted through air. Coughing and sneezing by an infected person can emit pathogen-containing particles with diameters less than 10 μm that can reach the alveolar region. Based on our analysis of the sparse literature on respiratory aerosols, we estimated that emitted particles quickly decrease in diameter due to water loss to one-half the initial values, and that in one cough the volume in particles with initial diameters less than 20 μm is 6 × 10-8 mL. The pathogen emission rate from a source case depends on the frequency of expiratory events, the respirable particle volume, and the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid. Viable airborne pathogens are removed by exhaust ventilation, particle settling, die-off, and air disinfection methods; each removal mechanism can be assigned a first-order rate constant. The pathogen concentration in well-mixed room air depends on the emission rate, the size distribution of respirable particles carrying pathogens, and the removal rate constants. The particle settling rate and the alveolar deposition fraction depend on particle size. Given these inputs plus a susceptible person's breathing rate and exposure duration to room air, an expected alveolar dose μ is estimated. If the infectious dose is one organism, as appears to be true for tuberculosis, infection risk is estimated by the expression: R = I- exp(-μ). Using published tuberculosis data concerning cough frequency, bacilli concentration in respiratory fluid, and die-off rate, we illustrate the model via a plausible scenario for a person visiting the room of a pulmonary tuberculosis case. We suggest that patients termed ""superspreaders"" or ""dangerous disseminators"" are those infrequently encountered persons with high values of cough and/or sneeze frequency, elevated pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid, and/or increased respirable aerosol volume per expiratory event such that their pathogen emission rate is much higher than average.

US EPA particulate matter research centers: Summary of research results for 2005-2011,"The US Environmental Protection Agency funded five academic research centers in 2005 to address uncertainties in the health effects caused by airborne particulate matter (PM) as suggested by the 1998 National Research Council report, ""Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter."" The centers employed multidisciplinary teams of epidemiologists, toxicologists, atmospheric scientists, engineers, and chemists to approach four key research themes: susceptibility to PM, biological mechanisms of PM response, exposure-response relationships, and source linkages. This review presents selected accomplishments in these categories from the past 5-year period. Publications from the centers are summarized to provide both an overview of the accomplishments to date and easy reference to much of the original literature published by the centers. Numerous investigators worked together within and across centers to investigate the relationships between atmospheric PM and health effects, including (a) the role of reactive oxygen species, inflammation, the nervous system, and the cardiovascular system, (b) particle characteristics such as size, composition, source, and temporal pattern of exposure, and (c) phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the population that influence the level of exposure and risk in response to a given exposure. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",8,Association between air pollution exposure and exhaled nitric oxide in an elderly population,"Particulate matter and atherosclerosis: role of particle size, composition and oxidative stress",Ambient particulate pollutants in the ultrafine range promote early atherosclerosis and systemic oxidative stress,Organic compound characterization and source apportionment of indoor and outdoor quasi-ultrafine PM in retirement homes of the Los Angeles basin,Evaluating the toxicity of airborne particulate matter and nanoparticles by measuring oxidative stress potential-a workshop report and consensus statement,Cardiac autonomic dysfunction: effects from particulate air pollution and protection by dietary methyl nutrients and metabolic polymorphisms,Rapid DNA methylation changes after exposure to traffic particles,Concentrated ambient particles alter myocardial blood flow during acute ischemia in conscious canines,Who is sensitive to the effects of particulate air pollution on mortality?

Particulate matter (PM) research centers (1999-2005) and the role of interdisciplinary center-based research,"Objective: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funded five academic centers in 1999 to address the uncertainties in exposure, toxicity, and health effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) identified in the ""Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter"" of the National Research Council (NRC). The centers were structured to promote interdisciplinary approaches to address research priorities of the NRC. In this report, we present selected accomplishments from the first 6 years of the PM Centers, with a focus on the advantages afforded by the interdisciplinary, center-based research approach. The review highlights advances in the area of ultrafine particles and traffic-related health effects as well as cardiovascular and respiratory effects, mechanisms, susceptibility, and PM exposure and characterization issues. Data Sources and Synthesis: The collective publications of the centers served as the data source. To provide a concise synthesis of overall findings, authors representing each of the five centers identified a limited number of topic areas that serve to illustrate the key accomplishments of the PM Centers program, and a consensus statement was developed.

Health effects associated with exposure to ambient air pollution,"The World Health Organization has identified ambient air pollution as a high public health priority, based on estimates of air pollution related death and disability-adjusted life years derived in its Global Burden of Disease initiative. The NERAM Colloquium Series on Health and Air Quality was initiated to strengthen the linkage between scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders by reviewing the current state of science, identifying policy-relevant gaps and uncertainties in the scientific evidence, and proposing a path forward for research and policy to improve air quality and public health. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of science addressing the impacts of air pollution on human health. The paper is one of four background papers prepared for the 2003 NERAM/AirNet Conference on Strategies for Clean Air and Health, the third meeting in the international Colloquium Series. The review is based on the framework and findings of the U.S. National Research Committee (NRC) on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter and addresses key questions underlying air quality risk management policy decisions.

Aerosol Dosimetry Considerations,"Dosimetric considerations are clearly essential to an adequate understanding of the health effects of inhaled particulate air pollutants. Defining exposure in terms of C • T is not adequate, because it ignores such important factors as volume of air inspired, aerosol inhalability, deposition efficiency, uniformity of deposition, local deposition intensities (eg, deposited dose per unit surface area), and the actions of particle clearance/redistribution mechanisms. By considering these and other potentially important dose-related factors, it may be possible to identify high-risk individuals within potentially susceptible subpopulations. When an individual is at high risk (because of disease or genetic or exposure history factors) and receives unusually high doses (because of anatomic, physiologic, and environmental factors), he or she is likely to be the most severely harmed. Some of the factors that predispose individuals to receiving high doses and being at high risk are identified, and others are still under investigation. It is important that these factors be more thoroughly incorporated into epidemiologic and human clinical investigations, so that individuals most severely affected can be identified clearly and protected appropriately. Otherwise, increasingly restrictive and costly particle control strategies may be pursued without significant net benefits to public health. Research intended to identify the more harmful particulate agents, combinations, and temporal exposure effects requires the use of laboratory animal models in the foreseeable future. Understanding species differences in particle deposition and clearance is fundamental to the use of such investigations. More is known about species differences in healthy animals than in health-compromised ones. Additional research on such compromised animal models is needed. Difficult problems remain in understanding the effects of low doses and the effects of mixtures and intermittent high- and low-level exposures. Until more is learned about these problems, it is difficult to have confidence in the effects of control strategies based on finding acceptable air concentrations of air pollutants one by one. Current coordinated research efforts are underway worldwide to better understand the potential adverse health effects of current particle exposures. The Committee on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter of the National Research Council has defined many important issues (including dosimetric ones) and a logical sequence of research activities to better understand them [39]. The identified National Research Council research agenda is a long-term proposition that provides important guidance to many research communities. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Research priorities for airborne particulate matter in the United States,"If air pollution has declined significantly during the past 30 years, then why did studies in the 1990s demonstrate that health risks still exist? Those studies also indicated that particulate matter, a poorly understood pollutant, is the culprit. Jonathan Samet at Johns Hopkins University and Raymond Wassel, K.

Fine PM measurements: Personal and indoor air monitoring,"This review compiles personal and indoor microenvironment particulate matter (PM) monitoring needs from recently set research objectives, most importantly the NRC published ""Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter (1998)"". Techniques and equipment used to monitor PM personal exposures and microenvironment concentrations and the constituents of the sampled PM during the last 20 years are then reviewed. Development objectives are set and discussed for personal and microenvironment PM samplers and monitors, for filter materials, and analytical laboratory techniques for equipment calibration, filter weighing and laboratory climate control. The progress is leading towards smaller sample flows, lighter, silent, independent (battery powered) monitors with data logging capacity to store microenvironment or activity relevant sensor data, advanced flow controls and continuous recording of the concentration. The best filters are non-hygroscopic, chemically pure and inert, and physically robust against mechanical wear. Semiautomatic and primary standard equivalent positive displacement flow meters are replacing the less accurate methods in flow calibration, and also personal sampling flow rates should become mass flow controlled (with or without volumetric compensation for pressure and temperature changes). In the weighing laboratory the alternatives are climatic control (set temperature and relative humidity), and mechanically simpler thermostatic heating, air conditioning and dehumidification systems combined with numerical control of temperature, humidity and pressure effects on flow calibration and filter weighing. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Statistical issues in the study of air pollution involving airborne particulate matter,"Epidemiological research in the early 1990s focusing on health effects of airborne particulate matter pointed to a statistical association between increases in concentration of particles in ambient air and increases in daily nonaccidental mortality, particularly among the elderly. These results appear consistent across a range of U.S. cities. This and other scientific and policy information formed the basis on which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) promulgated revised, stricter air quality standards for particulate matter in 1997. The schedule for implementing the revised standards is coincident with the completion by USEPA of a Second National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) review for ambient particulate matter by July 2002 based on current science and policy information. Concurrently, the U.S. Congress directed USEPA to seek advice from the National Academy of Sciences, resulting in formation of the National Research Council Committee on Research Priorities for Airborne Particulate Matter. In its 1998 report, the Committee identified 10 research priorities for setting regulatory standards for particulate matter. The 10th priority addressed statistical issues. To explore these issues, the National Research Center for Statistics and the Environment and the USEPA organized a 1998 interdisciplinary Workshop on Particulate Methodology. A primary objective of the Workshop was to initiate a statistical research program relevant to setting air quality standards for ambient particulate matter pollution to be completed during the second NAAQS review. This paper reports findings and recommendations from the Workshop and an agenda for statistical research motivated therefrom relevant to the study of air pollution involving particulate matter and to setting particulate matter air quality standards.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via contact and via the air between ferrets,"© 2020, The Author(s).SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that emerged in late 2019, has spread rapidly worldwide, and information about the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among humans is critical to apply appropriate infection control measures and to slow its spread. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted efficiently via direct contact and via the air (via respiratory droplets and/or aerosols) between ferrets, 1 to 3 days and 3 to 7 days after exposure respectively. The pattern of virus shedding in the direct contact and indirect recipient ferrets is similar to that of the inoculated ferrets and infectious virus is isolated from all positive animals, showing that ferrets are productively infected via either route. This study provides experimental evidence of robust transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via the air, supporting the implementation of community-level social distancing measures currently applied in many countries in the world and informing decisions on infection control measures in healthcare settings.",1,"A Novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019",A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin,The species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2,A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster,"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia","Pattern of early human-to-human transmission of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), December 2019 to January 2020","Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study",Transmission routes of respiratory viruses among humans,"Community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, Shenzhen, China, 2020","Active monitoring of persons exposed to patients with confirmed COVID-19 - United States, January–February 2020",Virology: SARS virus infection of cats and ferrets,Human monoclonal antibody as prophylaxis for SARS coronavirus infection in ferrets,Immunization with modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based recombinant vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome is associated with enhanced hepatitis in ferrets,The SARS-CoV ferret model in an infection-challenge study,Pathology of experimental SARS coronavirus infection in cats and ferrets,Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2,Infection and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets,Simulation of the clinical and pathological manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in golden Syrian hamster model: Implications for disease pathogenesis and transmissibility,"Susceptibility of ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals to SARS–coronavirus 2",Pathogenesis and transmission of swine-origin 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus in ferrets,Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faecal samples,"Air, surface environmental, and personal protective equipment contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a symptomatic patient",Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1,Escalating infection control response to the rapidly evolving epidemiology of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong,Development and implementation of real-time nucleic acid amplification for the detection of enterovirus infections in comparison to rapid culture of various clinical specimens,Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific antibody responses in coronavirus disease 2019 patients

This study examined effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Simulated sunlight and matrix significantly affected decay rate of the virus. Relative humidity alone did not affect the decay rate; however, minor interactions between relative humidity and other factors were observed. Mean decay rates (± SD) in simulated saliva, under simulated sunlight levels representative of late winter/early fall and summer were 0.121 ± 0.017 min−1 (90% loss, 19 minutes) and 0.306 ± 0.097 min−1 (90% loss, 8 minutes), respectively. Mean decay rate without simulated sunlight across all relative humidity levels was 0.008 ± 0.011 min−1 (90% loss, 286 minutes). These results suggest that the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on environmental conditions, particularly sunlight. These data may be useful to inform mitigation strategies to minimize the potential for aerosol transmission.",1,World Health Organization declares global emergency: A review of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19),Detection of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genome in an air sample originating from a camel barn owned by an infected patient,Detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and environmental contamination in SARS outbreak units,Detection of SARS-CoV and RNA on aerosol samples from SARS-patients admitted to hospital [in Chinese],Extensive viable Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus contamination in air and surrounding environment in MERS isolation wards,"Aerosol and surface distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in hospital wards, Wuhan, China, 2020 [published online ahead of print 10 April 2020]",Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals,Detection of air and surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in hospital rooms of infected patients,Quantity and size distribution of cough-generated aerosol particles produced by influenza patients during and after illness,Size distribution and sites of origin of droplets expelled from the human respiratory tract during expiratory activities,Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks,ViralloadofSARSCoV-2inclinicalsamples,SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory specimens of infected patients,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens,Exposure to influenza virus aerosols during routine patient care,Exposure to blood-containing aerosols in the operating room: a preliminary study,Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1,Survival characteristics of airborne human coronavirus 229E,Survival of aerosolized coronavirus in the ambient air,Effect of simulated solar radiation and sodium fluorescein on the recovery of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus from aerosols,The influence of simulated sunlight on the inactivation of influenza virus in aerosols,Stability of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) under different environmental conditions,Airborne micro-organisms: survival tests with four viruses,"Effects of temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, and evaporation potential on survival of airborne Gumboro vaccine virus",Beitrag zur kollektiven Behandlung pharmakologischer Reihenversuche,The method of “right and wrong cases”(“constant stimuli”) without Gauss's formulae,"Influenza virus aerosols in human exhaled breath: particle size, culturability, and effect of surgical masks",Measurements of airborne influenza virus in aerosol particles from human coughs,Effect of relative humidity on the survival of airborne unicellular algae,The use of a rotating drum for the study of aerosols over extended periods of time,Factors affecting the viability of air-borne bacteria: I.

Clinical management of COVID-19,"© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with its early origin from Wuhan city in China has evolved into a global pandemic. Maximal precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by most nations in war footing to mitigate transmission and decrease fatality rates. This article was aimed to review the evidence on clinical management and to deal with the identification of high-risk groups, warning signs, appropriate investigations, proper sample collection for confirmation, general and specific treatment measures, strategies as well as infection control in the healthcare settings. Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage. Among the currently available drugs, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, awaiting further clinical trials. Stringent droplet and contact precautions will protect healthcare workers against most clinical exposures to COVID-19.

"Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study","© 2020 Elsevier LtdBackground: A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation: COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

Experimental aerosol survival of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva and tissue culture media at medium and high humidity,"© 2020, © 2020 Crown Copyright. This article is published under an Open Government Licence www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/.SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be transmitted via airborne droplets or contact with surfaces onto which droplets have deposited. In this study, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to survive in the dark, at two different relative humidity values and within artificial saliva, a clinically relevant matrix, was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 was found to be stable, in the dark, in a dynamic small particle aerosol under the four experimental conditions we tested and viable virus could still be detected after 90 minutes. The decay rate and half-life was determined and decay rates ranged from 0.4 to 2.27 % per minute and the half lives ranged from 30 to 177 minutes for the different conditions. This information can be used for advice and modelling and potential mitigation strategies.",1,Aerosol and Surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1,A simple method of estimating fifty percent endpoints,Method for contamination of filtering face piece respirators by deposition of MS2 viral aerosols,Stability of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) under different environmental conditions,"The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol",The influence of simulated sunlight on the inactivation of influenza virus in aerosols,Effect of voicing and articulation manner on aerosol particle emission during human speech,The size distribution of droplets in the exhaled breath of healthy human subjects,Nosocomial transmission of Emerging Viruses via aerosol-Generating Medical procedures,A review of the risks and disease transmission associated with aerosol generating medical procedures
Factors involved in the age-dependent resistance of mice infected with low-virulence mouse hepatitis virus,"Four-week-old weanling mice survived, whereas 1-week-old suckling mice died, after intraperitoneal inoculation of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-S strain. The factors involved in this difference in susceptibility were studied. After virus inoculation, differences in virus growth in the liver and spleen were observed, which correlated with the susceptibility of animals to the virus. Interferon, detected at an early stage of infection, was considerably lower in suckling mice than in weanling mice. Titers of MHV-S in peritoneal cells from infected animals were at least 100 times greater in suckling than in weanling mice, and a similar, but less prominent difference in virus growth was also found in the corresponding cultured macrophages. After transfer of peritoneal cells from weanling to suckling mice, a decrease in mortality of infected suckling mice was observed. These results suggest that both interferon and macrophages may be important in the age-dependent resistance of mice to MHV-S infection. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",1,Lethal enteritis in infant mice caused by mouse hepatitis virus,Problems in checking inapparent infections in laboratory mouse colonies.

Clinical management of COVID-19,"© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with its early origin from Wuhan city in China has evolved into a global pandemic. Maximal precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by most nations in war footing to mitigate transmission and decrease fatality rates. This article was aimed to review the evidence on clinical management and to deal with the identification of high-risk groups, warning signs, appropriate investigations, proper sample collection for confirmation, general and specific treatment measures, strategies as well as infection control in the healthcare settings. Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage. Among the currently available drugs, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, awaiting further clinical trials. Stringent droplet and contact precautions will protect healthcare workers against most clinical exposures to COVID-19.

Airborne transmission route of covid-19: Why 2 meters/6 feet of inter-personal distance could not be enough,"© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world. In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 meters (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 meters from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 meters from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.",3,Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1,Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2: The world should face the reality,Coronavirus infections—More than just the common cold,Visualization of sneeze ejecta: Steps of fluid fragmentation leading to respiratory droplets,The coronavirus pandemic and aerosols: Does COVID-19 transmit via expiratory particles?,Could SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted via speech droplets?,Turbulent gas clouds and respiratory pathogen emissions: Potential implications for reducing transmission of COVID-19,Numerical simulation for behavior of virus in an indoor environment,G613 Transmission Simulation of virus droplet under the indoor environment,"Concentrations and size distributions of airborne influenza A viruses measured indoors at a health centre, a day-care centre and on aeroplanes",Relationship between Humidity and Influenza A Viability in Droplets and Implications for Influenza’s Seasonality,Haze is a risk factor contributing to the rapid spread of respiratory syncytial virus in children,Is short-term exposure to ambient fine particles associated with measles incidence in China?

Ventilation and health in non-industrial indoor environments: Report from a European Multidisciplinary Scientific Consensus Meeting (EUROVEN),"Scientific literature on the effects of ventilation on health, comfort, and productivity in non-industrial indoor environments (offices, schools, homes, etc.) has been reviewed by a multidisciplinary group of European scientists, called EUROVEN, with expertise in medicine, epidemiology, toxicology, and engineering. The group reviewed 105 papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and judged 30 as conclusive, providing sufficient information on ventilation, health effects, data processing, and reporting, 14 as providing relevant background information on the issue, 43 as relevant but non-informative or inconclusive, and 18 as irrelevant for the issue discussed. Based on the data in papers judged conclusive, the group agreed that ventilation is strongly associated with comfort (perceived air quality) and health [Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) symptoms, inflammation, infections, asthma, allergy, short-term sick leave], and that an association between ventilation and productivity (performance of office work) is indicated. The group also concluded that increasing outdoor air supply rates in non-industrial environments improves perceived air quality; that outdoor air supply rates below 25 l/s per person increase the risk of SBS symptoms, increase short-term sick leave, and decrease productivity among occupants of office buildings; and that ventilation rates above 0.5 air changes per hour (h-1) in homes reduce infestation of house dust mites in Nordic countries. The group concluded additionally that the literature indicates that in buildings with air-conditioning systems there may be an increased risk of SBS symptoms compared with naturally or mechanically ventilated buildings, and that improper maintenance, design, and functioning of air-conditioning systems contributes to increased prevalence of SBS symptoms.

Development of a dose-response model for SARS coronavirus,"In order to develop a dose-response model for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the pooled data sets for infection of transgenic mice susceptible to SARS-CoV and infection of mice with murine hepatitis virus strain 1, which may be a clinically relevant model of SARS, were fit to beta-Poisson and exponential models with the maximum likelihood method. The exponential model (k = 4.1 × l02) could describe the dose-response relationship of the pooled data sets. The beta-Poisson model did not provide a statistically significant improvement in fit. With the exponential model, the infectivity of SARS-CoV was calculated and compared with those of other coronaviruses. The does of SARS-CoV corresponding to 10% and 50% responses (illness) were estimated at 43 and 280 PFU, respectively. Its estimated infectivity was comparable to that of HCoV-229E, known as an agent of human common cold, and also similar to those of some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group. Moreover, the exponential model was applied to the analysis of the epidemiological data of SARS outbreak that occurred at an apartment complex in Hong Kong in 2003. The estimated dose of SARS-CoV for apartment residents during the outbreak, which was back-calculated from the reported number of cases, ranged from 16 to 160 PFU/person, depending on the floor. The exponential model developed here is the sole dose-response model for SARS-CoV at the present and would enable us to understand the possibility for reemergence of SARS. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.",1,Grand challenges in human coronavirus vaccine development,Current status of antiviral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus research,Modeling the SARS epidemic,A double epidemic model for the SARS propagation,Murine hepatitis virus strain 1 as a model for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS),Coronavirus pathogenesis and the emerging pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,Is there an ideal animal model for SARS?,Murine hepatitis virus strain 1 produces a clinically relevant model of severe acute respiratory syndrome in A/J mice,Lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,Pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory coronavirus deletion mutants in hACE-2 transgenic mice,"Effects of a ""new"" human respiratory virus in volunteers","Age dependent response of mice to a mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-S",Pathogenicity of mouse hepatitis virus for mice depending upon host age and route of infection,Neurotropisim of swine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (coronavirus) in mice depending upon host age and route of infection,Susceptibility of rats of different ages to inoculation with swine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (a coronavirus) by various routes,Cloacal inoculation with the Connecticut strain of avian infectious brouchitis virus: An attempt to produce nephropathogenic virus by in vivo passage using cloacal inoculation,"Multi-zone modeling of probable SARS virus transmission by airflow between flats in Block E, Amoy Gardens",Environmental transmission of SARS at Amoy Gardens,Evidence of airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus,Plaque assay and improved yield of human coronaviruses in a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line,Epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): Adults and children,Initial viral load and the outcomes of SARS,Human H5N1 influenza,The pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in infant ferrets,A mouse-adapted SARS-coronavirus causes disease and mortality in BALB/c mice,Pathology and virus dispersion in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus via different inoculation routes,Newly discovered coronavirus as the primary cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome,"Replication of SARS coronavirus administered into the respiratory tract of African Green, rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys",Animal models of human pneumonia.

Effective treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab,"© 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.After analyzing the immune characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes with large amount of interleukin 6 secreting may incite the inflammatory storm, which may potentially be curbed through monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People's Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020. The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days. Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy. CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%). The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab. Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.",2,Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus,Cross-host evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in palm civet and human,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in dromedary camels: An outbreak investigation,A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: A study of a family cluster,"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study","Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A single-centered, retrospective, observational study",Extraordinary GU-rich single-strand RNA identified from SARS coronavirus contributes an excessive innate immune response,Delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of innate antiviral response by the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: Implications for pathogenesis and treatment,Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome,Pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm in severe COVID-19 patients,Clinical experience of IL-6 blockade in rheumatic diseases-Implications on IL-6 biology and disease pathogenesis,Interleukin-6 and its receptors: A highly regulated and dynamic system,Therapeutic strategies for the clinical blockade of IL-6/gp130 signaling,Tocilizumab-a novel therapy for non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases,"Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal phase III trial","Tocilizumab monotherapy versus adalimumab monotherapy for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (ADACTA): A randomised, double-blind, controlled phase 4 trial",Correction,Possible compartmental cytokine release syndrome in a patient with recurrent ovarian cancer after treatment with mesothelin-targeted CAR-T cells
Clinical management of COVID-19,"© 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with its early origin from Wuhan city in China has evolved into a global pandemic. Maximal precautionary measures and resources have been put forward by most nations in war footing to mitigate transmission and decrease fatality rates. This article was aimed to review the evidence on clinical management and to deal with the identification of high-risk groups, warning signs, appropriate investigations, proper sample collection for confirmation, general and specific treatment measures, strategies as well as infection control in the healthcare settings. Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage. Among the currently available drugs, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir may be considered for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, awaiting further clinical trials. Stringent droplet and contact precautions will protect healthcare workers against most clinical exposures to COVID-19.

Infection and Rapid Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Ferrets,"© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and rapidly spread worldwide. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, understanding the in vivo characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 is a high priority. We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs. Thus, ferrets represent an infection and transmission animal model of COVID-19 that may facilitate development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.© 2020 Elsevier Inc.The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spreads, leading to a pandemic infection. Kim et al. show that ferrets are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectively transmit the virus by direct or indirect contact, recapitulating human infection and transmission.",1,The Pathogenicity of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in hACE2 Transgenic Mice,Animal models for influenza virus transmission studies: a historical perspective,Virus growth and antibody responses following respiratory tract infection of ferrets and mice with WT and P/V mutants of the paramyxovirus Simian Virus 5,Investigating viral interference between influenza A virus and human respiratory syncytial virus in a ferret model of infection,Origin and evolution of pathogenic coronaviruses,Development of a whole-virus ELISA for serological evaluation of domestic livestock as possible hosts of human coronavirus NL63,Ferret models of viral pathogenesis,Mechanisms of host defense following severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pulmonary infection of mice,Naming the 2019 Coronavirus,Viral Load Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in First Two Patients in Korea,Enteric involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection,Mouse-adapted MERS coronavirus causes lethal lung disease in human DPP4 knockin mice,Case of the Index Patient Who Caused Tertiary Transmission of COVID-19 Infection in Korea: the Application of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of COVID-19 Infected Pneumonia Monitored by Quantitative RT-PCR,Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding,Coronaviridae,Evaluation of heterosubtypic cross-protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 by active infection with human seasonal influenza A virus or trivalent inactivated vaccine immunization in ferret models,Altered virulence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N8 reassortant viruses in mammalian models,RNeasy Mini Handbook,Receptor recognition by the novel coronavirus from Wuhan: An analysis based on decade-long structural studies of SARS Coronavirus,WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19,2019-nCoV outbreak is an emergency of international concern,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report – 63,Differential sensitivities of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus spike polypeptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein ELISA for serodiagnosis of SARS coronavirus pneumonia,Characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential evidence for persistent fecal viral shedding,Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia,"Epidemiology and cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, People's Republic of China, in February, 2003","A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019"
COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system: A systematic review of the clinical trial landscape,"© Journal of Xiangya Medicine. All rights reserved.Background: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Due to its high rate of interpersonal transmission the disease rapidly spread in China resulting in an epidemic and subsequently a pandemic with severe impact on social, economic and medical systems globally. Our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its effects on the human body continues to evolve as new information becomes available. This paper is an overview of ongoing clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on August 3, 2020 to guide future research and clinical practice. Our objective is to do a systematic review of the existing trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov related to COVID-19 and the cardiovascular (CV) system. The aim of this is to describe the ongoing research in order to guide future practice and evaluate areas of deficiencies. Methods: We conducted our search on ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) on August 3, 2020 and used the key terms “COVID-19” and “cardiovascular. An independent two-person review was carried out for exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria was defined as studies that were terminated, withdrawn, suspended, of unknown status, or had no connection to the CV system. Three duplicate studies were removed; 141 studies were removed after an independent two person review determined that it did not hold any relevant connection to the CV system and two studies were removed from the data as they were withdrawn and suspended respectively. There were no conflicting opinions between the two researchers regarding the 141 clinical trials excluded. The remaining 122 studies included were then grouped together based on their primary and secondary objectives. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. No experiments involving humans were done by the researchers and therefore ethical approval was not required. Results: We found 122 studies applicable to our search criteria and then grouped them together based on topics of investigation as identified by primary and secondary objectives. The identified studies varied from observational, registry based and interventional with most of them falling into the first two categories. The studies were ongoing at that point and did not have results to report or analyze. Conclusions: Our search on ClinicalTrials.gov produced a variety of studies that investigate relationships between COVID-19 and the CV system. Our search identified the main areas with ongoing research that has the ability to resolve controversies regarding current management of patients with COVID-19 including the ideal thromboprophylaxis regimen; arrhythmogenic potential of patients with COVID-19 and appropriate monitoring of these patients and long term morbidity related to COVID-19 and the CV system. The key finding of our analysis is that the majority of the ongoing studies are observational in nature and not randomized controlled trials. Review of these ongoing studies can aid medical professionals and researchers in outlining current areas of clinical equipoise and help with planning prospective research study topics and design.",12,"COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system: A review of current data, summary of best practices, outline of controversies, and illustrative case reports",The effects of different angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers on the regulation of the ACE-AngII-AT1 and ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axes in pressure overload-induced cardiac remodeling in male mice,Localization of ACE2 in the renal vasculature: amplification by angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade using telmisartan,Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) use in COVID-19 prevention or treatment: A paradox,Good or bad: Application of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidities,Use of RAAS inhibitors and risk of clinical deterioration in COVID-19: results from an Italian cohort of 133 hypertensives,Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients with Covid-19,2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension,Coagulopathy in COVID-19,D-dimer is Associated with Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Pooled Analysis,"BML-111, a lipoxin receptor agonist, protects against acute injury via regulating the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system",Incidence and impact of cardiac arrhythmias in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A systematic review and meta-analysis,Cardiac and arrhythmic complications in patients with COVID-19,Review: Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine for Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19),Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72 314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,"Impact of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases on mortality and severity of COVID-19-systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression",Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China,Myocarditis revealing COVID-19 infection in a young patient,First case of COVID-19 complicated with fulminant myocarditis: a case report and insights,Recognizing COVID-19-related myocarditis: The possible pathophysiology and proposed guideline for diagnosis and management,"Correction to: Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China",Cardiovascular magnetic resonance in myocarditis: A JACC White Paper,Cardiovascular surgery in the COVID-19 pandemic,Cardiac Surgery in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Guidance Statement From the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons,Cardiovascular Implications in Patients Infected with Covid-19 and the Importance of Social Isolation to Reduce Dissemination of the Disease,Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic can increase physical inactivity and the global burden of cardiovascular disease
Cardiovascular implications of the COVID-19 pandemic,"© 2021 The AuthorsThe COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly emerged as one of the biggest public health concerns of the 21st century. Although it was initially reported as a cluster of pneumonia cases, it quickly became apparent that COVID-19 is not merely a respiratory tract infection. Its clinical course is often complicated by cardiovascular manifestations including venous and arterial thrombosis, electrical disturbances, and myocardial damage. In addition, the cardiovascular system is involved not only during infection but also preceding the contraction of the virus; having cardiovascular comorbidities indicates significant vulnerability to the pathogen. As longer-term data continue to accumulate, we now have concerns over its lasting cardiovascular effects after recovery. Moreover, there have been substantial collateral effects on the epidemiology of cardiovascular diseases. Reports of adverse cardiovascular events from vaccination have emerged as new hurdles to our efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. As such, the association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular practice in general is expansive. In this review, we provide an overview of the knowledge and considerations in this field, based on the evidence available at the time of this writing.",12,Factors associated with hospital admission and critical illness among 5279 people with coronavirus disease 2019 in New York City: Prospective cohort study,Features of 20 133 UK patients in hospital with covid-19 using the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol: prospective observational cohort study,Clinical epidemiology of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan: Report of the COVID-19 Registry Japan,"Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China",Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil,"Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy region, Italy",Impact of cardiovascular disease and risk factors on fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19 according to age: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure hospitalized with COVID-19,"Clinical presentation, disease course and outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with and without pre-existing cardiac disease – a cohort study across sixteen countries",ACC health policy statement on cardiovascular disease considerations for COVID-19 vaccine prioritization,Interplay between inflammation and thrombosis in cardiovascular pathology,Cardiovascular complications in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Venous and arterial thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic hospital in Milan, Italy",Thrombosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a New York City health system,Pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19,COVID-19 and its cardiovascular effects: a systematic review of prevalence studies,Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,The stimulation of thrombosis by hypoxia,Immobilization and the risk of venous thromboembolism.

"COVID-19 and cardiac injury: clinical manifestations, biomarkers, mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and follow up","© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has the characteristics of high transmission, diverse clinical manifestations, and a long incubation period. In addition to infecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 also has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. COVID-19 causes acute myocardial injuries, as well as chronic damage to the cardiovascular system. Areas covered: The present review is aimed at providing current information on COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, and Google Scholar were searched. Expert opinion: It is suggested that heart injury caused by COVID-19 infection might be an important cause of severe clinical phenotypes or adverse events in affected patients. Myocardial damage is closely related to the severity of the disease and even the prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition to disorders that are caused by COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, more protection should be employed for patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hence, it is very important that once relevant symptoms appear, patients with COVID-19 be rapidly treated to reduce mortality. Thus, early measurements of cardiac damage via biomarkers following hospitalization for COVID-19 infections in a patient with preexisting CVD are recommended, together with careful monitoring of any myocardial injury that might be caused by the infection.

Covid-19 and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review,"© 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.Cardiac injury in patients infected with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) seems to be associated with higher morbimortality. We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.",12,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular disease,SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor,Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China,The pathogenesis and treatment of the ‘Cytokine Storm′ in COVID-19,"Presenting characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes among 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area",Arterial hypertension and risk of death in patients with COVID-19 infection: systematic review and meta-analysis,Risk factors of critical & mortal COVID-19 cases: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis,"Effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors on virus inhection, inflammatory status, and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension: a single-center retrospective study",Increased arterial stiffness in resistant hypertension is associated with inflammatory biomarkers,"Association of Cardiac Injury With Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",Cardiac Involvement in a Patient With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular disease: A viewpoint on the potential influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on onset and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection,Life-threatening cardiac tamponade complicating myo-pericarditis in COVID-19,Cardiovascular Implications of Fatal Outcomes of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),The ACE2 expression in human heart indicates new potential mechanism of heart injury among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2,Executive group on behalf of the Joint European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/World Heart Federation (WHF) Task Force for the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction,Incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19,Recognizing COVID-19-related myocarditis: The possible pathophysiology and proposed guideline for diagnosis and management,"COVID-19 and thrombotic or thromboembolic disease: implications for prevention, antithrombotic therapy, and follow-up",Anticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy,"Guidance for cardiac electrophysiology during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic from the Heart Rhythm Society COVID-19 Task Force; Electrophysiology Section of the American College of Cardiology; and the Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, American Heart Association","SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and inherited arrhythmia syndromes","Hydroxychloroquine in patients with mainly mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019: open label, randomised controlled trial",Risk of QT interval prolongation associated with use of hydroxychloroquine with or without concomitant azithromycin among hospitalized patients testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Azithromycin, cardiovascular risks, QTc interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and regulatory issues: a narrative review based on the study of case reports",Inhibition of hERG K+ currents by antimalarial drugs in stably transfected HEK293 cells,Compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with severe Covid-19,A trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in adults hospitalized with severe Covid-19,Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers and the risk of Covid-19,Evidence that renin–angiotensin system inhibitors should not be discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic,Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and risk of Covid-19,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor: molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic target,"Hypertension, the renin-angiotensin system, and the risk of lower respiratory tract infections and lung injury: implications for COVID-19"
COVID-19 and the Cardiovascular System,"© 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.COVID-19, a symptom complex of respiratory failure induced by a highly infectious pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been classified as a pandemic. As of April 15, 2020, there have been 2 million people diagnosed with the viral infection and 130 000 deaths globally. It is highly likely that the number of infections is underrepresented secondary to variations in testing and reporting strategies globally. In this short review, we aim to summarize the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. We discuss the basis of cardiac pathophysiology and address some of the clinical scenarios that cardiovascular physicians may face. We introduce the concept of conservative management of acute coronary syndromes and address some complications such as myocarditis, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias that may be relevant for the management of patients presenting with COVID-19.",12,"COVID-19 for the cardiologist: A current review of the virology, clinical epidemiology, cardiac and other clinical manifestations and potential therapeutic strategies",Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2),"Presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 - Singapore, January 23-March 16, 2020",Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different types of clinical specimens,Surviving Sepsis Campaign: Guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China,"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective cohort study","Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China","Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China","Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study","Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China",Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Association of cardiac injury with mortality in hospitalized patients with covid-19 in Wuhan, China",Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in a patient with COVID-19,Coronavirus fulminant myocarditis treated with glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin,SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor,Does the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ACE2 balance contribute to the fate of angiotensin peptides in programmed hypertension?,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key modulator of the renin angiotensin system in health and disease,The emerging role of ACE2 in physiology and disease,Hydrolysis of biological peptides by human angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase,A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular disease: A viewpoint on the potential influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers on onset and severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with Covid-19,"Cardiovascular considerations for patients, health care workers, and health systems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic",Reduction in ST-segment elevation cardiac catheterization laboratory activations in the United States during COVID-19 pandemic,Association between influenza vaccination and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients: A meta-analysis,Acute myocardial infarction after laboratory-confirmed influenza infection,Cardiac involvement in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),Catheterization laboratory considerations during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: From ACC's Interventional Council and SCAI,"COVID-19, arrhythmias and inflammation: Mind the gap!","SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and inherited arrhythmia syndromes",Urgent guidance for navigating and circumventing the QTc-prolonging and torsadogenic potential of possible pharmacotherapies for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19),Considerations for drug interactions on QTc in exploratory COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) treatment,A risk score to predict QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients,Development and validation of a risk score to predict QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients,Ventricular arrhythmia risk due to hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin treatment for COVID-19
COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease: from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives,"© 2020, Springer Nature Limited.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic that has affected the lives of billions of individuals. Extensive studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with SARS-CoV, the zoonotic virus that caused the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, including the system of cell entry, which is triggered by binding of the viral spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Clinical studies have also reported an association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself can also induce myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism. Potential drug–disease interactions affecting patients with COVID-19 and comorbid cardiovascular diseases are also becoming a serious concern. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives, focusing on the interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. By combining our knowledge of the biological features of the virus with clinical findings, we can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19, paving the way towards the

COVID-19 and the impact of cardiovascular comorbiditiesCOVID-19 und die Bedeutung der kardiovaskulären Komorbidität,"© 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.Since its outbreak, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly resulted in a global pandemic. Underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with severe COVID-19 infection and adverse clinical outcomes. While COVID-19 predominantly causes respiratory symptoms, a substantial number of patients eventually develop an acute cardiovascular syndrome associated with an excessive risk of mortality. While the exact mechanisms remain uncertain, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays a pivotal role as a link between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. As there is no evidence that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system is harmful in COVID-19, therapy should be continued as indicated in hypertension or heart failure patients. As multiple drugs are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials, potential cardiotoxicity remains an important issue. In times of rigorous public health measures such as social distancing, efforts should be undertaken to ensure timely treatment of acute CVD and continuation of guideline-directed treatment in order to avoid an increase in morbidity and mortality. In addition to its acute complications, COVID-19 is likely to be associated with long-term cardiovascular damage. Consequently, for a subgroup of patients a long-term management strategy is needed.",12,Characteristics of and Important Lessons from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72 314 Cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention,"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China","Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China","Baseline Characteristics and Outcomes of 1591 Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2 Admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy","Presenting Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Outcomes among 5700 Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City Area",Obesity a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19 Infection: Multiple Potential Mechanisms,Endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in COVID-19,"Association of Cardiac Injury with Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China",Description and Proposed Management of the Acute COVID-19 Cardiovascular Syndrome,Pulmonary Embolism in COVID-19 Patients: Awareness of an Increased Prevalence,Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2,Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection?,"Association of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors with Severity or Risk of Death in Patients with Hypertension Hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection in Wuhan, China",Association of Inpatient Use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers with Mortality among Patients with Hypertension Hospitalized with COVID-19,Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients with Covid-19,Guidance on Minimizing Risk of Drug-Induced Ventricular Arrhythmia during Treatment of COVID-19: A Statement from the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society,Effect of High vs Low Doses of Chloroquine Diphosphate as Adjunctive Therapy for Patients Hospitalized with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection: A Randomized Clinical Trial,Decline of acute coronary syndrome admissions in Austria since the outbreak of COVID-19: The pandemic response causes cardiac collateral damage,Improving long-term outcomes after discharge from intensive care unit: Report from a stakeholders' conference,Coronaviruses and the cardiovascular system: Acute and long-term implications
Cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 patients—A systematic review,"© 2020 The Authors. Journal of Cardiac Surgery published by Wiley Periodicals LLCObjectives: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the worst global pandemic of our generation, affecting 215 countries with nearly 5.5 million cases. The association between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system has been well described. We sought to systematically review the current published literature on the different cardiac manifestations and the use of cardiac-specific biomarkers in terms of their prognostic value in determining clinical outcomes and correlation to disease severity. Methods: A systematic literature review across PubMed, Cochrane database, Embase, Google Scholar, and Ovid was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant articles that discussed risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations in COVID-19 patients, and cardiac-specific biomarkers with their clinical implications on COVID-19. Results: Sixty-one relevant articles were identified which described risk factors for cardiovascular manifestations, cardiac manifestations (including heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmia, and myocarditis among others) and cardiac-specific biomarkers (including CK-MB, CK, myoglobin, troponin, and NT-proBNP). Cardiovascular risk factors can play a crucial role in identifying patients vulnerable to developing cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 and thus help to save lives. A wide array of cardiac manifestations is associated with the interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. Cardiac-specific biomarkers provide a useful prognostic tool in helping identify patients with the severe disease early and allowing for escalation of treatment in a timely fashion. Conclusion: COVID-19 is an evolving pandemic with predominate respiratory manifestations, however, due to the interaction with the cardiovascular system; cardiac manifestations/complications feature heavily in this disease, with cardiac biomarkers providing important prognostic information.",12,"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China",COVID-19 and Multiorgan Response,The impact of COVID-19 on the provision of cardiac surgical services,"Influenza epidemics and acute respiratory disease activity are associated with a surge in autopsy-confirmed coronary heart disease death: results from 8 years of autopsies in 34,892 subjects",Acute myocardial infarction after laboratory-confirmed influenza infection,Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after acute infection or vaccination,"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China",Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses: the PRISMA statement,Clinical characteristics of 113 deceased patients with coronavirus disease 2019: retrospective study,"Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study","Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China",Characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019,"Association of Cardiac Injury With Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study",Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Baseline characteristics and outcomes of 1591 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs of the Lombardy Region, Italy","Cardiovascular disease drug therapy, and mortality in Covid-19","Clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and outcomes of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): early report from the United States","Correction to: clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China","Hospitalization and critical care of 109 decedents with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China",Cardiological society of India position statement on COVID-19 and heart failure,The variety of cardiovascular presentations of COVID-19,Myocardial localization of coronavirus in COVID-19 cardiogenic shock,COVID-19 and cardiogenic shock.

"COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system: Implications for risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment options","© 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the greatest medical challenge in decades. We provide a comprehensive review of the clinical course of COVID-19, its comorbidities, and mechanistic considerations for future therapies. While COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, causing interstitial pneumonitis and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it also affects multiple organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. Risk of severe infection and mortality increase with advancing age and male sex. Mortality is increased by comorbidities: Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and cancer. The most common complications include arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and ventricular fibrillation), cardiac injury [elevated highly sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) and creatine kinase (CK) levels], fulminant myocarditis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2, following proteolytic cleavage of its S protein by a serine protease, binds to the transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-a homologue of ACE-to enter type 2 pneumocytes, macrophages, perivascular pericytes, and cardiomyocytes. This may lead to myocardial dysfunction and damage, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, plaque instability, and myocardial infarction (MI). While ACE2 is essential for viral invasion, there is no evidence that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) worsen prognosis. Hence, patients should not discontinue their use. Moreover, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors might be beneficial in COVID-19. Initial immune and inflammatory responses induce a severe cytokine storm [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-7, IL-22, IL-17, etc.] during the rapid progression phase of COVID-19. Early evaluation and continued monitoring of cardiac damage (cTnI and NT-proBNP) and coagulation (D-dimer) after hospitalization may identify patients with cardiac injury and predict COVID-19 complications. Preventive measures (social distancing and social isolation) also increase cardiovascular risk.

At the heart of COVID-19,"© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLCCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) first presented in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. Since then, it has rapidly spread across the world, and is now formally considered a pandemic. The disease does not discriminate but increasing age and the presence of comorbidities are associated with severe form of the disease and poor outcomes. Although the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with cardiovascular disease is under-reported, there is evidence that pre-existing cardiac disease can render individuals vulnerable. It is thought that COVID-19 may have both a direct and indirect effect on the cardiovascular system; however, the primary mechanism of underlying cardiovascular involvement is still uncertain. Of particular interest is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is well known for its cardiovascular effects and is also considered to be important in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. With a range of different drug candidates being suggested, effective anti-virals and vaccines are an area of on-going research. While our knowledge of COVID-19 continues to rapidly expand, this review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system.",12,Identification of a novel coronavirus causing severe pneumonia in human,"Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China",Has China faced only a herald wave of SARS-CoV-2?,Unknown unknowns—COVID-19 and potential global mortality,"Severe outcomes among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—United States, February 12–March 16, 2020",Comorbidity and its impact on 1590 patients with Covid-19 in China: a nationwide analysis,COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system,Potential effects of coronaviruses on the cardiovascular system,"Emerging coronaviruses: genome structure, replication, and pathogenesis",Receptor recognition by the novel coronavirus from Wuhan: an analysis based on decade-long Structural studies of SARS coronavirus,A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus–induced lung injury,Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China,Prevalence and impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19 in China,Characteristics of and important lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China,"Cardiovascular considerations for patients, health care workers, and health systems during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic",Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cardiovascular disease,"Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China",Association of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with myocardial injury and mortality,"SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and inherited arrhythmia syndromes",Coronavirus fulminant myocarditis saved with glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin,First case of COVID-19 infection with fulminant myocarditis complication: case report and insights,Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice,SARS-coronavirus modulation of myocardial ACE2 expression and inflammation in patients with SARS,Pulmonary involvement in patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,"Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China",Prognostic significance of elevated cardiac troponin-T levels in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients,Clinical review: myocardial depression in sepsis and septic shock,Cardiac and arrhythmic complications in Covid-19 patients,Cardiovascular implications of fatal outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),A risk assessment model for the identification of hospitalized medical patients at risk for venous thromboembolism: the padua prediction score,Risk assessment of venous thromboembolism and bleeding in COVID-19 patients,Predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2: a prospective cohort study,The variety of cardiovascular presentations of COVID-19,"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study",COVID-19 and Multi-Organ Response,Solidarity,ACE inhibitors and COVID-19: we don't know yet,"Impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction care in Hong Kong, China",Altered lipid metabolism in recovered SARS patients twelve years after infection
