We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak involving three families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, assessed the possibility of airborne transmission, and characterized the associated environmental conditions. We collected epidemiological data, obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the index case. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas concentration decay method. This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families (A, B, C). All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 24, 2020. None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the measured ventilation rate was 0.9 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was identified, aside from back-to-back sitting in some cases. Analysis of the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of long-range transmission of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is possible in crowded space with a ventilation rate of 1 L/s per person.","2021-06-01","2021-04-23 23:00:01","2021-11-12 20:03:18","2021-04-23 23:00:01","107788","","","196","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/PPGX835H/Li et al. - 2021 - Probable airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a .pdf","","China; COVID-19; Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; disease transmission; Aerosol transmission; Airborne transmission; Building ventilation; Coronaviruses; ventilation; Ventilation; Ventilation rate; Aerosols; aerosol; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; concentration (composition); Drops; SARS coronavirus; building; Building ventilations; Condition; Coronavirus disease 2019; disease spread; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Tracer gas; Transmissions; Video recording; Viruses","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle. Methods: Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced. Results: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus. © 2020 The Author(s)","2020","2021-11-01 22:17:13","2021-11-12 20:03:01","","476-482","","","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","","","human; controlled study; hospital discharge; nonhuman; ambient air; hospital admission; hospital; Humans; Hospitals; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; pandemic; Article; microbiology; Aerosols; Air Microbiology; aerosol; air sampling; animal cell; consensus sequence; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; genomic RNA; high throughput sequencing; isolation and purification; LLC-MK2 cell line; nucleotide sequence; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Sanger sequencing; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; teaching hospital; university hospital; Vero C1008 cell line; virology; virus concentration; virus culture; virus detection; virus genome; virus pneumonia; virus RNA; virus strain; virus viability; water vapor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The group reviewed 105 papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and judged 30 as conclusive, providing sufficient information on ventilation, health effects, data processing, and reporting, 14 as providing relevant background information on the issue, 43 as relevant but non-informative or inconclusive, and 18 as irrelevant for the issue discussed. Based on the data in papers judged conclusive, the group agreed that ventilation is strongly associated with comfort (perceived air quality) and health [Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) symptoms, inflammation, infections, asthma, allergy, short-term sick leave], and that an association between ventilation and productivity (performance of office work) is indicated. The group also concluded that increasing outdoor air supply rates in non-industrial environments improves perceived air quality; that outdoor air supply rates below 25 l/s per person increase the risk of SBS symptoms, increase short-term sick leave, and decrease productivity among occupants of office buildings; and that ventilation rates above 0.5 air changes per hour (h-1) in homes reduce infestation of house dust mites in Nordic countries. The group concluded additionally that the literature indicates that in buildings with air-conditioning systems there may be an increased risk of SBS symptoms compared with naturally or mechanically ventilated buildings, and that improper maintenance, design, and functioning of air-conditioning systems contributes to increased prevalence of SBS symptoms.

Prior studies have described an association of increased self-reported colds and influenza-like symptoms with low ventilation but have not combined rigorous characterization of ventilation with assessment of laboratory confirmed infections. We report a study designed to fill this gap. We followed laboratory confirmed ARI rates and measured CO2 concentrations for four months during the winter-spring of 2018 in two campus residence halls: (1) a high ventilation building (HVB) with a dedicated outdoor air system that supplies 100% of outside air to each dormitory room, and (2) a low ventilation building (LVB) that relies on infiltration as ventilation. We enrolled 11 volunteers for a total of 522 person-days in the HVB and 109 volunteers for 6069 person-days in the LVB, and tested upper-respiratory swabs from symptomatic cases and their close contacts for the presence of 44 pathogens using a molecular assay. We observed one ARI case in the HVB (0.70/person-year) and 47 in the LVB (2.83/person-year). Simultaneously, 154 CO2 sensors distributed primarily in the dormitory rooms collected 668,390 useful data points from over 1 million recorded data points. Average and standard deviation of CO2 concentrations were 1230 ppm and 408 ppm in the HVB, and 1492 ppm and 837 ppm in the LVB, respectively. Importantly, this study developed and calibrated multi-zone models for the HVB with 229 zones and 983 airflow paths, and for the LVB with 529 zones and 1836 airflow paths by using a subset of CO2 data for model calibration. The models were used to calculate ventilation rates in the two buildings and potential for viral aerosol migration between rooms in the LVB. With doors and windows closed, the average ventilation rate was 12 L/s in the HVB dormitory rooms and 4 L/s in the LVB dormitory rooms. As a result, residents had on average 6.6 L/(s person) of outside air in the HVB and 2.3 L/(s person) in the LVB. LVB rooms located at the leeward side of the building had smaller average ventilation rates, as well as a somewhat higher ARI incidence rate and average CO2 concentrations when compared to those values in the rooms located at the windward side of the building. Average ventilation rates in twenty LVB dormitory rooms increased from 2.3 L/s to 7.5 L/s by opening windows, 3.6 L/s by opening doors, and 8.8 L/s by opening both windows and doors. Therefore, opening both windows and doors in the LVB dormitory rooms can increase ventilation rates to the levels comparable to those in the HVB. But it can also have a negative effect on thermal comfort due to low outdoor temperatures. Simulation results identified an aerobiologic pathway from a room occupied by an index case of influenza A to a room occupied by a possible secondary case. © 2020 The Authors","2020","2021-11-01 22:17:12","2021-11-12 19:54:38","","","","","137","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/MI9VHRUP/Zhu et al. - 2020 - Ventilation and laboratory confirmed acute respira.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32028176","adult; female; human; major clinical study; male; incidence; priority journal; controlled study; United States; nonhuman; young adult; influenza; disease control; laboratory test; Students; biological marker; study design; student; exposure; Humans; Male; Female; Young Adult; Universities; Temperature; Maryland; disease transmission; Article; infectious disease; ventilation; Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI); Air Pollution, Indoor; Airborne infection control; College dormitory rooms; Housing; Infectious bioaerosols; Multi-zone model; Respiratory Tract Infections; Ventilation; Ventilation rate; Aerosols; virus concentration; air conditioning; indoor air pollution; air temperature; Airborne infection; Bioaerosols; carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; college student; concentration (composition); disease incidence; Doors; housing; indoor air; infection rate; Influenza A virus; lung ventilation; Multi-zone models; respiratory airflow; respiratory disease; respiratory tract infection; School buildings; seasonal variation; temperature; university; university sector","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Coughing and sneezing by an infected person can emit pathogen-containing particles with diameters less than 10 μm that can reach the alveolar region. Based on our analysis of the sparse literature on respiratory aerosols, we estimated that emitted particles quickly decrease in diameter due to water loss to one-half the initial values, and that in one cough the volume in particles with initial diameters less than 20 μm is 6 × 10-8 mL. The pathogen emission rate from a source case depends on the frequency of expiratory events, the respirable particle volume, and the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid. Viable airborne pathogens are removed by exhaust ventilation, particle settling, die-off, and air disinfection methods; each removal mechanism can be assigned a first-order rate constant. The pathogen concentration in well-mixed room air depends on the emission rate, the size distribution of respirable particles carrying pathogens, and the removal rate constants. The particle settling rate and the alveolar deposition fraction depend on particle size. Given these inputs plus a susceptible person's breathing rate and exposure duration to room air, an expected alveolar dose μ is estimated. If the infectious dose is one organism, as appears to be true for tuberculosis, infection risk is estimated by the expression: R = I- exp(-μ). Using published tuberculosis data concerning cough frequency, bacilli concentration in respiratory fluid, and die-off rate, we illustrate the model via a plausible scenario for a person visiting the room of a pulmonary tuberculosis case. We suggest that patients termed ""superspreaders"" or ""dangerous disseminators"" are those infrequently encountered persons with high values of cough and/or sneeze frequency, elevated pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid, and/or increased respirable aerosol volume per expiratory event such that their pathogen emission rate is much higher than average.

After that rehearsal, 53 members of the SVC among 61 in attendance were confirmed or strongly suspected to have contracted COVID-19 and two died. Transmission by the aerosol route is likely; it appears unlikely that either fomite or ballistic droplet transmission could explain a substantial fraction of the cases. It is vital to identify features of cases such as this to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was dominated by inhalation of respiratory aerosol generated by one index case, we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of aerosol infectious quanta. We explore how the risk of infection would vary with several influential factors: ventilation rate, duration of event, and deposition onto surfaces. The results indicate a best-estimate emission rate of 970 ± 390 quanta/h. Infection risk would be reduced by a factor of two by increasing the aerosol loss rate to 5 h−1 and shortening the event duration from 2.5 to 1 h. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We explored interpersonal exposure of exhaled droplets and droplet nuclei of two standing thermal manikins as affected by distance, humidity, ventilation, and breathing mode. Under the specific set of conditions studied, we found a substantial increase in airborne exposure to droplet nuclei exhaled by the source manikin when a susceptible manikin is within about 1.5 m of the source manikin, referred to as the proximity effect. The threshold distance of about 1.5 m distinguishes the two basic transmission processes of droplets and droplet nuclei, that is, short-range modes and the long-range airborne route. The short-range modes include both the conventional large droplet route and the newly defined short-range airborne transmission. We thus reveal that transmission occurring in close proximity to the source patient includes both droplet-borne (large droplet) and short-range airborne routes, in addition to the direct deposition of large droplets on other body surfaces. The mechanisms of the droplet-borne and short-range airborne routes are different; their effective control methods also differ. Neither the current droplet precautions nor dilution ventilation prevents short-range airborne transmission, so new control methods are needed. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Ten of them, who had significantly lower concentrations of pre-existing antibody than the rest, became infected and eight of these developed colds. A limited investigation of circulating lymphocyte populations showed some lymphocytopenia in infected volunteers. In this group, antibody concentrations started to increase 1 week after inoculation and reached a maximum about 1 week later. Thereafter antibody titres slowly declined. Although concentrations were still slightly raised 1 year later, this did not always prevent reinfection when volunteers were then challenged with the homologous virus. However, the period of virus shedding was shorter than before and none developed a cold.

R0 determines the herd immunity threshold and therefore the immunisation coverage required to achieve elimination of an infectious disease. As R0 increases, higher immunisation coverage is required to achieve herd immunity. In July, 2010, a panel of experts convened by WHO concluded that measles can and should be eradicated. Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, regions have had varying success in measles control, in part because measles is one of the most contagious infections. For measles, R0 is often cited to be 12–18, which means that each person with measles would, on average, infect 12–18 other people in a totally susceptible population. We did a systematic review to find studies reporting rigorous estimates and determinants of measles R0. Studies were included if they were a primary source of R0, addressed pre-existing immunity, and accounted for pre-existing immunity in their calculation of R0. A search of key databases was done in January, 2015, and repeated in November, 2016, and yielded 10 883 unique citations. After screening for relevancy and quality, 18 studies met inclusion criteria, providing 58 R0 estimates. We calculated median measles R0 values stratified by key covariates. We found that R0 estimates vary more than the often cited range of 12–18. Our results highlight the importance of countries calculating R0 using locally derived data or, if this is not possible, using parameter estimates from similar settings. Additional data and agreed review methods are needed to strengthen the evidence base for measles elimination modelling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2017","2021-11-01 22:17:10","2021-11-12 20:02:06","","e420-e428","","12","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Lancet Publishing Group","","; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757186; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28757186","human; priority journal; prophylaxis; systematic review; Humans; Models, Biological; Review; Measles; disease transmission; Disease Transmission, Infectious; transmission; infection control; basic reproduction number; biological model; developed country; developing country; disease elimination; herd immunity; immunity; measles; measles vaccination; measles vaccine; population density; seroprevalence; susceptible population","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact (<2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing. The large droplet route only dominates when the droplets are larger than 100 μm and when the subjects are within 0.2 m while talking or 0.5 m while coughing. The smaller the exhaled droplets, the more important the short-range airborne route. The large droplet route contributes less than 10% of exposure when the droplets are smaller than 50 μm and when the subjects are more than 0.3 m apart, even while coughing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","2020","2021-11-01 22:17:10","2021-11-12 20:01:15","","","","","176","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","","","","20th century; Civil engineering; Buildings; respiratory disease; Close contact; Close proximity; Disease transmission; dispersion; droplet; Droplet dispersion; Drops; Exposure; health risk; Large droplet; numerical model; Short-range airborne; twentieth century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings: 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). Interpretation: COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1–3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R 0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). Methods: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a ""lockdown"" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the ""lockdown"" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. Results: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R 0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. Conclusions: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance. © 2020 The Author(s).","2020","2021-11-01 22:17:08","2021-11-12 20:02:27","","","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd.","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/JH57Q6G9/Jarvis et al. - 2020 - Quantifying the impact of physical distance measur.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/FB9QZVI2/Jarvis et al. - 2020 - Quantifying the impact of physical distance measur.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/NQ7NQNI2/s12916-020-01597-8.html; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/C24RIDRP/s12916-020-01597-8.html","","adult; aged; female; human; middle aged; male; incidence; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; child; demography; daily life activity; normal human; young adult; epidemic; age; United Kingdom; e-mail; health care policy; human experiment; Humans; Adult; Surveys and Questionnaires; Incidence; COVID-19; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Contact Tracing; Epidemics; Social Isolation; pandemic; disease transmission; Activities of Daily Living; Pandemic; Article; Models, Theoretical; Contact survey; Disease outbreak; nCov; Reproduction number; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; virus pneumonia; infection control; social isolation; basic reproduction number; Basic Reproduction Number; contact examination; Health Policy; human relation; Interpersonal Relations; online system; preschool child; school child; social distance; theoretical model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All these viruses were rescued in monkey (Vero E6) cells and were also infectious for human (Huh-7, Huh7.5.1 and CaCo-2) cell lines and for transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), indicating that none of these proteins is essential for the viral cycle. Furthermore, in Vero E6 cells, all the viruses showed the formation of particles with the same morphology as the wt virus, indicating that these proteins do not have a high impact in the final morphology of the virions. Nevertheless, in the absence of E protein, release of virus particles efficacy was reduced. Viruses lacking E protein grew about 100-fold lower than the wt virus in lungs of Tg infected mice but did not grow in the brains of the same animals, in contrast to the rSARS-CoV-Δ[6-9b] virus, which grew almost as well as the wt in both tissues. Viruses lacking E protein were highly attenuated in the highly sensitive hACE-2 Tg mice, in contrast to the minimal rSARS-CoV-Δ[6-9b] and wt viruses.

A suitable small animal model is needed to support the development of vaccines and therapies. Here we report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in golden (Syrian) hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells and areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia at 7 days after inoculation. We also found viral antigens in epithelial cells of the duodenum, and detected viral RNA in faeces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was not as efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss on days 6–7 post-inoculation or post-contact; all hamsters returned to their original weight within 14 days and developed neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden hamsters resemble those found in humans with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","2020","2021-11-01 22:17:06","2021-11-12 20:06:37","","834-838","","7818","583","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","","","","male; priority journal; controlled study; disease model; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; body weight loss; metabolism; pathogenesis; Male; Animals; Weight Loss; Lung; Kidney; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus; Antibodies, Viral; Disease Models, Animal; pandemic; RNA; Article; Animalia; virus; Aerosols; Antibodies, Neutralizing; RNA, Viral; aerosol; animal cell; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virology; virus pneumonia; virus RNA; virus transmission; animal; virus antibody; fomite; Fomites; Nasal Mucosa; virus load; immunology; SARS coronavirus; lung; pathology; animal experiment; animal model; pathogenicity; Alveolar Epithelial Cells; animal housing; animal tissue; antibody; Antigens, Viral; Bronchi; bronchus; bronchus epithelium; cell; cell hyperplasia; Cricetinae; detection method; duodenum; Duodenum; feces analysis; Housing, Animal; infectivity; inoculation; kidney; lung alveolus cell; lung alveolus epithelium cell; Mesocricetus; Mesocricetus auratus; nasal lavage fluid; neutralizing antibody; nose mucosa; Rhinolophus; rodent; Syrian hamster; viral clearance; Viral Load; virus antigen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viral clearance and subsequent recovery from infection require activation of an effective host immune response; however, many immune effector cells may also cause injury to host tissues. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, with 10%and 35% overall mortality rates, respectively; however, >50% mortality rates are seen in the aged and immunosuppressed populations. While these viruses are susceptible to interferon treatment in vitro, they both encode numerous genes that allow for successful evasion of the host immune system until after high virus titres have been achieved. In this review, we discuss the importance of the innate immune response and the development of lung pathology following human coronavirus infection.

We measure the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities (RH); median estimated virus half-life is &gt;24 hours at 10◦C and 40 % RH, but ∼1.5 hours at 27◦C and 65 % RH. Our mechanistic model uses fundamental chemistry to explain why inactivation rate increases with increased temperature and shows a U-shaped dependence on RH. The model accurately predicts existing measurements of five different human coronaviruses, suggesting that shared mechanisms may affect stability for many viruses. The results indicate scenarios of high transmission risk, point to mitigation strategies, and advance the mechanistic study of virus transmission. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza. We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (""coarse"">5 μm, ""fine""≤5 μm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus. Fine particles contained 8.8 (95% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak (r = 0.17, coarse; r = 0.29, fine fraction). Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples. Surgical masks worn by patients reduce aerosols shedding of virus. The abundance of viral copies in fine particle aerosols and evidence for their infectiousness suggests an important role in seasonal influenza transmission. Monitoring exhaled virus aerosols will be important for validation of experimental transmission studies in humans. © 2013 Milton et al.","2013","2021-11-01 22:17:04","2021-11-12 20:04:44","","","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","article; female; human; male; asthma; clinical article; fever; nonhuman; risk; disease transmission; aerosol; exhalation; particle size; Influenza virus; correlation analysis; cultural anthropology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; surgical mask","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide evidence of a mode of transmission seldom considered for influenza: airborne virus transport on microscopic particles called “aerosolized fomites.” In the guinea pig model of influenza virus transmission, we show that the airborne particulates produced by infected animals are mainly non-respiratory in origin. Surprisingly, we find that an uninfected, virus-immune guinea pig whose body is contaminated with influenza virus can transmit the virus through the air to a susceptible partner in a separate cage. We further demonstrate that aerosolized fomites can be generated from inanimate objects, such as by manually rubbing a paper tissue contaminated with influenza virus. Our data suggest that aerosolized fomites may contribute to influenza virus transmission in animal models of human influenza, if not among humans themselves, with important but understudied implications for public health. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020","2021-11-01 22:17:04","2021-11-12 20:00:25","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/FXZ6A4A9/Asadi et al. - 2020 - Influenza A virus is transmissible via aerosolized.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/IK4KXGSJ/Asadi et al. - 2020 - Influenza A virus is transmissible via aerosolized.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/X7FXEXSD/s41467-020-17888-w.html; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/N96MSNK4/s41467-020-17888-w.html","","article; female; human; disease model; nonhuman; influenza; public health; Humans; Female; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; disease transmission; Animalia; Aerosols; Particle Size; Influenza, Human; aerosol; virology; Influenza A virus; virus transmission; animal; particle size; fomite; Fomites; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; detection method; airborne virus; Cavia; guinea pig; guinea pig model; Guinea Pigs; Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Orthomyxoviridae; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; orthomyxovirus infection; particulate matter; Particulate Matter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We report a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission that recapitulates aspects of human disease. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets exhibit elevated body temperatures and virus replication. Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission. Viral antigens were detected in nasal turbinate, trachea, lungs, and intestine with acute bronchiolitis present in infected lungs.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20–23, Feb 11–14, and March 10–13, 2020. Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by Rt has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34–53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated Rt of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26–1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70–0·74) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24–43%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an Rt of 1·10 (1·06–1·12) before the start of the school closures to 0·73 (0·68–0·77) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74·5%, 97·5%, and 98·8% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61·3%, 90·2%, and 85·1% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. Interpretation: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

The factors involved in this difference in susceptibility were studied. After virus inoculation, differences in virus growth in the liver and spleen were observed, which correlated with the susceptibility of animals to the virus. Interferon, detected at an early stage of infection, was considerably lower in suckling mice than in weanling mice. Titers of MHV-S in peritoneal cells from infected animals were at least 100 times greater in suckling than in weanling mice, and a similar, but less prominent difference in virus growth was also found in the corresponding cultured macrophages. After transfer of peritoneal cells from weanling to suckling mice, a decrease in mortality of infected suckling mice was observed. These results suggest that both interferon and macrophages may be important in the age-dependent resistance of mice to MHV-S infection. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.","1979","2021-11-01 22:17:02","2021-11-12 20:06:42","","333-340","","4","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer-Verlag","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/TQKSQVMR/Taguchi et al. - 1979 - Factors involved in the age-dependent resistance o.pdf","","in vitro study; Animal; Mice; Cells, Cultured; Aging; Liver; Virulence; experimental infection; animal experiment; mouse; Animals, Suckling; Ascitic Fluid; Comparative Study; Hepatitis, Viral, Animal; Interferons; Macrophages; murine hepatitis coronavirus; Murine hepatitis virus; Spleen; virus infection; Virus Replication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cornerstone of protection remains vaccination, and approved vaccines seek to elicit a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of>1:40 as the primary correlate of protection. However, recent poor vaccine performance raises questions regarding the protection afforded and whether other correlates of protection should be targeted. A healthy volunteer challenge study was performed with a wild-type 2009 A(H1N1)pdm influenza A challenge virus at the NIH Clinical Center to evaluate two groups of participants with HAI titers of>1:40 and<1:40. The primary objective was to determine whether participants with HAI titers of>1:40 were less likely to develop mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) after intranasal inoculation. HAI titers of>1:40 were protective against MMID but did not reduce the incidence of symptoms alone. Although the baseline HAI titer correlated with some reduction in disease severity measures, overall, the baseline NAI titer correlated more significantly with all disease severity metrics and had a stronger independent effect on outcome. This study demonstrates the importance of examining other immunological correlates of protection rather than solely HAI titers. This challenge study confirms the importance of NAI titer as a correlate and for the first time establishes that it can be an independent predictor of reduction of all aspects of influenza disease. This suggests that NAI titer may play a more significant role than previously thought and that neuraminidase immunity should be considered when studying susceptibility after vaccination and as a critical target in future influenza vaccine platforms. IMPORTANCE This study represents the first time the current gold standard for evaluating influenza vaccines as set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a “protective” hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of≥1:40, has been evaluated in a well-controlled healthy volunteer challenge study since the cutoff was established. We used our established wild-type influenza A healthy volunteer human challenge model to evaluate how well this antibody titer predicts a reduction in influenza virus-induced disease. We demonstrate that although higher HAI titer is predictive of some protection, there is stronger evidence to suggest that neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titer is more predictive of protection and reduced disease. This is the first time NAI titer has been clearly identified in a controlled trial of this type to be an independent predictor of a reduction in all aspects of influenza. © 2016 Memoli et al.","2016","2021-11-01 22:17:01","2021-11-12 20:04:07","","","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: American Society for Microbiology","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/7RV25DAJ/Memoli et al. - 2016 - Evaluation of Antihemagglutinin and Antineuraminid.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/JZU4JZA5/Memoli et al. - 2016 - Evaluation of Antihemagglutinin and Antineuraminid.pdf; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094330; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094330","adult; female; human; middle aged; male; disease severity; incidence; outcome assessment; priority journal; controlled study; symptom; adolescent; United States; nonhuman; normal human; young adult; prediction; human experiment; gold standard; antibody titer; Humans; Male; Adult; Female; Young Adult; Middle Aged; Adolescent; vaccination; Healthy Volunteers; Vaccination; Antibodies, Viral; Influenza Vaccines; Article; Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza, Human; Neuraminidase; virology; virus antibody; virus shedding; immunity; immunology; physiology; antibody response; Influenza A virus (H1N1); 2009 H1N1 influenza; H1N1 virus hemagglutinin; hemagglutination inhibition; immunological parameters; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; sialidase; virus sialidase; wild type","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People's Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between 5 and 14 February 2020. The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Fever returned to normal on the first day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days. Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75.0%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy. CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%). The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85.0% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean, 15.52 ± 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the fifth day after treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab.

Its estimated infectivity was comparable to that of HCoV-229E, known as an agent of human common cold, and also similar to those of some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group. Moreover, the exponential model was applied to the analysis of the epidemiological data of SARS outbreak that occurred at an apartment complex in Hong Kong in 2003. The estimated dose of SARS-CoV for apartment residents during the outbreak, which was back-calculated from the reported number of cases, ranged from 16 to 160 PFU/person, depending on the floor. The exponential model developed here is the sole dose-response model for SARS-CoV at the present and would enable us to understand the possibility for reemergence of SARS. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.","2010","2021-11-01 22:16:58","2021-11-12 19:55:05","","1129-1138","","7","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","article; human; disease model; statistical model; epidemic; risk; validation study; epidemiology; Humans; Databases, Factual; Mice; Animals; Mice, Transgenic; Likelihood Functions; Risk; Models, Biological; Poisson Distribution; China; Hong Kong; Disease Outbreaks; Coronavirus Infections; SARS Virus; Disease Models, Animal; Coronaviruses; Animalia; virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Coronavirus infection; virology; animal; biological model; numerical model; virus load; SARS coronavirus; Viruses; mouse; Mus; Mus musculus; pathogenicity; severe acute respiratory syndrome; transgenic mouse; infectivity; rodent; Viral Load; Murine hepatitis virus; Apartment houses; Common cold; data set; Data sets; Dose response relationships; Dose-response model; Dose-response models; dose-response relationship; Exponential models; factual database; floor; Genetic groups; hepatitis; Hepatitis virus; Hong-kong; maximum likelihood analysis; Maximum likelihood estimation; maximum likelihood method; Maximum likelihood methods; Murine hepatitis coronavirus; Murine hepatitis virus strain 1; Poisson distribution; Poisson model; SARS outbreak in Hong Kong; Transgenic mice; viral disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relative significance between contact, droplet, and airborne transmission is yet to be defined, a knowledge gap for implementing evidence-based infection control measures. We devised a transmission chamber that separates virus-laden particles by size and determined the particle sizes mediating transmission of influenza among ferrets through the air. Ferret-to-ferret transmission was mediated by airborne particles larger than 1.5 ?m, consistent with the quantity and size of virus-laden particles released by the donors. Onward transmission by donors was most efficient before fever onset and may continue for 5 days after inoculation. Multiple virus gene segments enhanced the transmissibility of a swine influenza virus among ferrets by increasing the release of virus-laden particles into the air. We provide direct experimental evidence of influenza transmission via droplets and fine droplet nuclei, albeit at different efficiency. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

This study provides evidence from a natural experiment on the effects of state government mandates for face mask use in public issued by fifteen states plus Washington, D.C., between April 8 and May 15, 2020. The research design is an event study examining changes in the daily county-level COVID-19 growth rates between March 31 and May 22, 2020. Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020.

This study examined effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Simulated sunlight and matrix significantly affected decay rate of the virus. Relative humidity alone did not affect the decay rate; however, minor interactions between relative humidity and other factors were observed. Mean decay rates (± SD) in simulated saliva, under simulated sunlight levels representative of late winter/early fall and summer were 0.121 ± 0.017 min−1 (90% loss, 19 minutes) and 0.306 ± 0.097 min−1 (90% loss, 8 minutes), respectively. Mean decay rate without simulated sunlight across all relative humidity levels was 0.008 ± 0.011 min−1 (90% loss, 286 minutes). These results suggest that the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on environmental conditions, particularly sunlight. These data may be useful to inform mitigation strategies to minimize the potential for aerosol transmission. © The Author(s) 2020.

Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations. © 2015 Nature America, Inc.

The rapid global spread of COVID-19 represents perhaps the most significant public health emergency in a century. As the pandemic progressed, a continued paucity of evidence on routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has resulted in shifting infection prevention and control guidelines between classically-defined airborne and droplet precautions. During the initial isolation of 13 individuals with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, we collected air and surface samples to examine viral shedding from isolated individuals. We detected viral contamination among all samples, supporting the use of airborne isolation precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020","2021-11-06 22:44:44","2021-11-06 22:44:44","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Nature Research","","","","human; public health; metabolism; genetics; Humans; Public Health; Time Factors; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Infection Control; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; procedures; pandemic; time factor; Aerosols; RNA, Viral; aerosol; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; virus RNA; infection control; physiology; pathology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; air pollutant; Air Pollutants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural municipalities in China (not including Hubei Province). We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and their associated indoor environmental aspects. Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, comprising a total of 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home-based outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport-based outbreaks (108; 34.0%), and many outbreaks occurred in more than one category of venue. All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in indoor environments, which confirm that sharing indoor spaces with one or more infected persons is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.","2021-05","2021-11-06 22:40:34","2021-11-12 20:05:21","","639-645","","3","31","","Indoor Air","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33131151","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/6AJGBXEX/Qian et al. - 2021 - Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/GVTV58G8/Qian et al. - 2021 - Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/C4DG2DU6/Qian et al. - 2021 - Indoor transmission of SARS-CoV-2.pdf; ; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131151; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131151","","Humans; China; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; SARS-CoV-2; Air Pollution, Indoor; Air Microbiology; Built Environment; crowding; Disease Transmission, Infectious; indoor environments; indoor hygiene; outbreak","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18th January 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable – with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity – including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.","2020-01-25","2021-11-06 21:40:31","2021-11-12 20:02:18","2021-11-06 21:27:19","","","","","","","Report 3","","","","","Imperial College London","","en-US-GB","© 2020.

The purpose of this document is to examine the different parameters necessary for an effec­tive upper-room UVGI system and to provide guidelines to healthcare managers, facility designers, engineers, and industrial hygienists on the parameters necessary to install and maintain an effective upper-room UVGI system. These guidelines are consistent with previous CDC healthcare guidelines and expand upon them. This document provides an overview of the current knowledge concerning upper-room UVGI systems and research needs. Information from CDC/NIOSH-funded laboratory studies and other relevant studies is combined in this report to provide guide­lines for the installation and use of upper-room UVGI systems. Although other pathogenic microorganisms may be killed or inactivated by upper-room UVGI systems, the guidelines were developed for the installation and use of upper-room UVGI systems capable of killing or inactivating surrogates of mycobacteria.","2009-03-01","2021-11-06 21:40:31","2021-11-12 20:04:51","2021-11-06 21:14:28","","","","","","","Environmental control for tuberculosis","","","","","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.26616/NIOSHPUB2009105","","/Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/GZQBDPE9/2009 - Environmental control for tuberculosis basic uppe.pdf; /Users/jodi/Zotero/storage/6K6NAC6R/2009 - Environmental control for tuberculosis basic uppe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4BFBTEIF","report","2020","Bundgaard, Henning; Rigshospitalet; Nordsjaellands Hospital; Hvidovre University Hospital; Herlev Hospital; Technical University of Denmark","Reduction in COVID-19 Infection Using Surgical Facial Masks Outside the Healthcare System","","","","","https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04337541","In the current COVID-19 pandemic with coronavirus, SARS-COV2, the Danish Health Authorities recommend using facial masks in the health care system when handling patients presumed or proven to be infected with the virus. However, the use of facial masks outside the health care system is not recommended by the Danish Health Authorities. Here, Health Authorities in other countries have different recommendations for the use of facial masks. Challenges when using facial masks outside the health care system include wearing the mask consistently, an efficacy of the mask of app. 8 hours necessitating a change of mask throughout the day, and that it is not sufficiently tight enough to safely keep the virus out. Moreover, the eyes (mucous membrane) remain exposed. Compliance could also be another challenge. SARS-COV2 is assumed to primarily enter the body via the mouth through respiratory droplets - or possibly through inhalation of aerosol containing the virus. From the mouth the virus is assumed to spread to the airways and the gastro-intestinal tract. SARS-COV2 is also known to be transmitted via physical contact, helped along by the fact that the virus can survive on surfaces for at least 72 hours. Touching such a contaminated surface can transfer the virus to the mouth via the hand - and thus lead to infection of the person. Facial masks are expected to protect against viral infection in two ways; By reducing the risk of getting the virus in via the mouth or nose via respiratory droplets or aerosol By reducing the transfer from virus-contaminated hands to the mouth or nose Hypothesis The use of surgical facial masks outside the hospital will reduce the frequency of COVID-19 infection. All participants will follow authority recommendations and be randomized to either wear facial masks or not. The participants will be screened for antibodies at study start and study end. They will perform swab-test if they experience symptoms during the study as well as the end of study.","2020-07","2021-11-06 21:40:31","2021-11-12 20:00:51","2021-09-13 00:00:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Clinical trial registration","","","clinicaltrials.gov","","submitted: April 2, 2020","","","","","","","","","Rigshospitalet; Nordsjaellands Hospital; Hvidovre University Hospital; Herlev Hospital; Technical University of Denmark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NCT04337541","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
